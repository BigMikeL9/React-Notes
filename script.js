  / General Things to remember 
  
 - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. HTML, CSS & JavaScript are about building user interfaces as well. React just makes building complex interactive and reactive user            interfaces SIMPLER.
 
 - ‚≠ê React uses a 'Declarative' Approach. With declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps. React is declarative because we write the code that we want and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result. Like so üëá {with React we just define the required end state and React will then generate these instructions behind the scenes to bring that on to the screen in the browser}

For example, instead of exposing open() and close() methods on a Dialog component, pass an isOpen prop to it.


 ------------------
    const App = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
          <p>This code is created using a Declarative Approach</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default App;
------------------
 
 - On the other hand with Vanilla JavaScript we use an 'Imperative' Approach because we are giving the browser clear step by step instructions of what JavaScript and the browser should be doing, for example when creating an element using JS and then changing its textContent, like so üëá {Very combersome and rendundant as our project gets bigger and we have too many elements}
------------------
    const paragraph = document.createElement('p');
    paragraph.textContent = 'This is an Imperative way of creating an HTML element using JS'
    document.getElemenetById('root').append(paragraph); 
------------------
  
 - To start seeing the changes live on the browser, you need to run "npm start" in the directory's/folder location (which uses node.js [backend server-side] to update the browser automatically) 
  
 - In React, we build a component tree that has one root node. A component tree is when we build a tree by nesting components into each other - just as when we build an HTML tree when building a standard HTML document.

 / React App files structure
     
 - 'src' folder is where the files that we will write our react code is located.
 
 - All react code is JavaScript code. 
      
 - ‚≠ê In React the "index.js" file is the FIRST file to be executed when running in the browser, unlike in Native Javascript where the "index.html" file is the first to be executed and then the rest.
  
 - React only has one HTML file because in React we build Single page Applications. So only one HTML file is delivered to the browser, and then rendered, hosted by the browser. But on this single HTML file, we render the finished react application code which then updates what we see on the screen, giving us the illusion of a multiple page website (multiple HTML pages), when in fact it is only one page (one HTML file), only the stuff/elements on it changes.
 
 - React tranforms our code into code that the browser would understand. For instance,  "import './index.css'" does NOT work with Vanilla Javascript (invalid syntax). We cant import a CSS file into a JavaScript file in vanilla JavaScript. But React does its magic behind the scenes and converts the code into something the browser will understand.
 
 - We ommit the ".js" when importing javascript script files in the "index.js" file. Example: "import App from './App';"    NOT     "import App from './App.js';"
  BUT if its another file type like a css file, then we keep the ".css". Like so: "import './index.css';"

// -------------------------------------------------------------
 / What is JSX?

 - JSX code (Javascript XML) is HTML code inside Javscript. [HTML is XML] 
    JSX only works in React. React transforms this JSX code to valid code/syntax that the browser can undertsand before delivering it to the browser, in a browser-friendly way which the browser can understand. The React transformation code, transforms our JSX code behind the scenes and then delivers it to the browser in way just as if we wrote it in normal HTML, CSS, and Javscript code.
    
 - In the past, developers had to add "import React from 'react'" in every component or in any file that has JSX code inside. But this is not the case in newer versions of React Apps. We dont need to import React from 'react' in every file anymore (Add it from now on tho. Also try 'console.log(React)' to see all the built-in React methods).  
  
---- üåü 'REACT JSX TRANSFORMATION, UNDER THE HOOD' üåü ----
 - How JSX is compiled to code that the browser can understand, UNDER THE HOOD üëáüëá
 
        // ------ JSX code ------
              import Expenses from "./components/Expenses";

              const App = () => {
                return (
                  <div>
                    <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
                    <p>This code is done using a Declarative Approach</p>
                  
                    <Expenses expenses={expenses}></Expenses>
                  </div>
                );
              };

              export default App;

              const App = () => {
                // React.createElement(type, props, children)
                return React.createElement(
                  "div",
                  {},
                  React.createElement("h2", {}, "Let's get started!"),
                  React.createElement("p", {}, "This code is done using a Declarative Approach"),
                  React.createElement(Expenses, { expenses: expenses })
                );

// -------------------------------------------------------------
 / What are Components in React?
    
 - A COMPONENT IN REACT, IS JUST A JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION that returns JSX code (HTML inside Javascript) which is transformed behind the scene by react into a browser-friendly code.

 - React is all about "Components". Components are just custom HTML elements. They are named like this "<App />".
    An example of Components is the "<App />" in the "index.js" file.

 - ‚≠ê‚≠ê The "App.js" file is a SPECIAL kind of component. It will be our ROOT component which means its the main component being rendered in our starting file (the "index.js" file). All other components that we create will be nested inside the "App.js" file or nested inside of other components which in the end are nested in "App.js".        LOOK AT --> {React Component Tree} image  
    
 - ‚≠ê It is considered good practice to create new files for different components, so that we have one file per component.
        Which means that we will have ALOT of files in react projects.
        
 - Create a folder called 'components' where you place all the new components you create in to keep it organized. Excluding "App.js" and "index.js"
   
 - When naming component files in react, its a common convention to make every word capitalized. Ex: "ExpenseItem.js"
    
 - The conventional way of the naming a function/component in react, is to name it the same thing as its file name.
 
 - In React, we ultimately build our own custom HTML elements, which are COMPONENTS. So components in react are simply custom HTML elements.
 
 - ‚≠ê Our own custom Components *MUST* start with an uppercase character when we are using them in JSX (ie: <ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>) , so that React is able to detect that this is a custom component.
      So the simple rule in React is that lowsercase elements (ie: <div></div>) are built-in HTML elements, whereas elements starting with an uppercase are custom elements defined by a developer.
                        We also have to use the name that we define in the import, as our custom HTML tag when used in JSX. 
                              
                                                               
--- So it is always these steps in React when creating and using custom compoenents--> 
              1. We create a component, which is a JavaScript function that returns HTML code
              2. We then Export that function (ie: export default ExpenseItem;)
              3. Then import the function as a custom HTML element in the file that we want to use it in.(ie: import ExpenseItem from './components/ExpenseItem')
              4. Finally use the imported function in the JSX code as an HTML element with the exception that every word is capitalized (ie: <ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>)
                                        ‚≠ê‚≠ê ' IMPORTANT NOTE: If there is no content inside a custom component, we can make it a self closing custom component (ie: <ExpenseItem />)
                                                                                                                                         
   
    
  - ‚≠êüå†‚≠êüå† When creating React components, an IMPORTANT rule to remember about the JSX code inside the JavaScript function, is that it MUST have only ONE root element per 'return' statement or per JSX code snippet (ie: example of root element -> '<div></div>'). The reason why it is not allowed will be explained later in the course.
              A workaround if we want multiple elements inside the JSX code snippet, is to wrap the entire JSX code with a '<div></div>' element or angle brackets '<> </>'. And then wrapping the whole               thing in brackets (). In short, the return value of React components must return only one root element which can have any code/number of elements inside. Like so üëá 

  // -- using a '<div></div>' element üí® (so here we have ONE root element which is the '<div></div>' element wrapping the around the whole JSX code snippet) üí®
const ExpenseItem = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Date</h2>
      <div>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <div>Amount</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

 // -- using angle brackets '<></>'  üí® (so here we have ONE root element which is the '<></>' element wrapping the around the whole JSX code snippet) üí®
const ExpenseItem = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Date</h2>
      <div>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <div>Amount</div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

 / Organizing Components into Sub-Folders

 - As the application gets bigger and bigger, it good practice to organize components into sub-folders üëá

 /   STYLING Components in React

- We style React components normally using CSS or any preprocessor (ie: Sass)

- We ussually create a CSS file for each componeNts. And give it the same name as the componenet JS file that it will belong to. Then we put them in the same folder.

- We then add our styling for that component in the component's CSS file. 

- Then link the component's CSS file to the component's JavaScript function using 'import' statement . Like so üëâ (import './ExpenseItem.css')

- üåü IMPORTANT -> The linked CSS file styling is NOT SCOPED to just the JS component function they are linked to. They are available GLOBALLY. See section below that explains how to make component styling SCOPED (only available to the component they are linked to)
    
- ADDING CLASSES to JSX code in React -> We dont use 'class' attribute as we would do in regular HTML, instead we use the 'className' attribute. Thats because React component code is NOT HTML it is JSX, a special syntax that only React understands. In the end, under the hood, it is still JavaScript code. And since it is JavaScript code in the end we cant use 'class' attribute becuase it is a reserved word in JavaScript which is why 'className' attribute was created to replace it. (NOTE: most attributes in JSX are the same as HTML attributes, but not all, like 'class' attribute for instance)


    // Example: 
          import "./ExpenseItem.scss";

          const ExpenseItem = () => {
            return (
              <div className="expense-item">
                <div>December 12, 2022</div>

                <div className="expense-item__description">
                  <h2>Car Insurance</h2>
                  <div className="expense-item__price">$312.56</div>
                </div>
              </div>
            );
          };

          export default ExpenseItem;


// ---------------------------
    ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT ->' Why not to use Bootstrap or other CSS library '
// ---------------------------

In a React app like in every other website you can use Bootstrap for styling, or any other framework, or the native CSS features - CSS flexbox (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), CSS grid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEnRpy9Xfes&list=PLbSquHt1VCf1x_-1ytlVMT0AMwADlWtc1) etc..

These native CSS features are much more powerful today (and much more flexible) than Bootstrap etc. can ever be, and they don't require additional nested markup.

So from my point of view you should use Bootstrap in real apps only if you are forced to use it, by working in a company which at this point of time has not yet recognized the huge advantages of the modern native CSS techniques. But as Prateek wrote, that's not at all related to React, the topic of this course.

 /   Outputting Dynamic Data & Working with Expressions in JSX  

 - Typically in React Applications, we dont have hardcoded data in HTML, instead they are fetched from somewhere and then DYNAMICALLY inserted into the JSX code.
 
 - To output DYNAMIC data in JSX code, we use special syntax created by React inside the JSX code snippets. Which is wrapping basic JavaScript expressions (for instance: variables) inside curly braces '{}'. Like so: '<h2>{2 + 4}</h2>'

    // Example:
          import "./ExpenseItem.scss";

          const ExpenseItem = () => {
            const expenseDate = new Date();
            const expenseTitle = "Car Insurance";
            const expenseAmount = 316.56;

            return (
              <div className="expense-item">
                <div>{expenseDate.toUTCString()}</div>

                <div className="expense-item__description">
                  <h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
                  <div className="expense-item__price">{expenseAmount}</div>
                </div>
              </div>

 /   Passing Data via "Props" (stands for PROPERTIES) in React (VERY IMPORTANT IN REACT) üåüüåüüåü

// GOOD EXPLANATION -> https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)

- React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using 'props'.

- 'Props' is a special keyword in React, which stands for PROPERTIES and is used for passing data from one component to another. But the important part here is that data get passed with props in a uni-directional flow. (one way from PARENT to CHILD)

- Remember, 'props' is used to pass data from PARENT to CHILD, and NOT the other way around (CHILD to PARENT)

- Furthermore, 'props' data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components. 
                          [Parent is -> the React component which '<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>' custom Element is being used inside. ie: const App = () => { return ('<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>') }. So 'App' component is the parent] 
                          [Child is -> the custom Element React component itself. ie: const ExpenseItem = () => { return (....) }]

- React components can ONLY have ONE argument, which is 'props' (Can be named anything tho). Which holds all the values that we passed in attributes, in custom Elements. We can define our own attributes & assign values, to custom Elements, with interpolation '{ }'                                                         ('<ChildComponent text={‚ÄúI‚Äôm the 1st child‚Äù} />').

- Also when passing data using 'props' from parent to child, we CANNOT skip components in between.
                          
- 'props' (which is passed in as an argument in React components), returns back an object from which we can access all the data passed in to the custom elements (attribute and its value (data)). 
We get key-value pairs from the 'props' object. Keys are the attribute names passed in the custom element. And values are the values of these attributes. 

-- USING 'props' in React -> // (Remember React components are JavaScript functions)
        1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value (data) in a custom Element being used in another React component (ie: '<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>') üëá
                      We already know that we can assign attributes and values to HTML tags: '<a href="www.google.com">Click here to visit Google</a>;'
                      Likewise, we can do the same for React components. We can define our own attributes & assign values with interpolation '{ }': 
                                                            '<ChildComponent someAttribute={value} anotherAttribute={value}/>'
                                                            '<ChildComponent text={‚ÄúI‚Äôm the 1st child‚Äù} />'

        2. Then we pass 'props' as an argument to the custom Element React component (ie: 'ChildComponent') which brings all the necessary data  üëá
                      Pass 'props' as an argument to the React component:
                                        const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
                                          return (...) 
                                        };
                      'props' return back an object. Try 'console.log(props);'

        3. Finally, render the Props Data. We will render the props object by using string interpolation '{ }' in the JSX code. üëá
                                 const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
                                    return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
                                 };

 /   Splitting Components into Multiple components (Preference)

 - As we work on React Applications, our react components eventually gets BIGGER and BIGGER, as we have more logic in the App. 
 
 - Which is why React has this components aspect, which allows us to split our application into smaller building blocks. Where every component/building block is focused on one core task.
 
 - This makes each compoenent small and manageable, while still being able to build complex applications by combining these componenets/building blocks.

---- 'What is composition? 
  „Ä∞ Composition is the act of assembling components or elements to build a whole. React gives a powerful tool that helps with composition, which is 'children-props'. 

---- 'Why Use React Composition?
  „Ä∞ This pattern gives us the power to build more scalable reusable components, especially when building a tool, a library, or components used by a large number of people with varying needs.
  „Ä∞ It prevents us from building too many similar components containing DUPLICATE CODE and allows us to build fewer components that can be reused anywhere within our application, making them easier to understand and maintain.


  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Remember that the JSX code inside a component MUST only have ONE root element per 'return' statement (ie: example of root element is '<div></div>' in 'return()'-> 'return( <div>...</div> )'). But that root element can be a custom HTML element, with styling that will be reused all over our App. 
                - But in React, we CANNOT use custom HTML Elements as root elements or wrappers around other custom Elements. So inorder to make it work
                        1. We pass in 'props' as an argument in the wrapper custom Element's component function 
                        2. And then we call the 'children' method on the 'props' object (which is available in ALL react components) between curly braces, inside the custom                                                          Element's component JSX code. (ie: "<div className="card">{props.children}</div>" ) 
 

  - The 'props.children' property is available on every component, that has custom HTML Elements nested inside. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a custom HTML Element that is being used as a root element/wrapper. So in the example below 'props.children' is equal to everything in between the '<Card> ... </Card>' custom element.

                        3. Also 'className="..."' DOES NOT work when used on custom wrapper Elements (üõë'<Card className="expense-item"> ... </Card>'üõë) because they do NOT support 'className="..."' attributes, like default HTML tags does. 
                            So inorder to make 'className="..."' (that is set on our custom wrapper element) WORK, we need to dynamically add any 'className' values that is added to our wrapper custom element (ie: '<Card className="expense-item"> ... </Card>'), to the wrapper custom element component function, by doing somehting like this üëá
                                                                                                                   const classes = `card ${props.className}`;   // -> using TEMPLATE LITERAL
                                                                                                                   const classes = 'card ' + props.className;    // -> using CONCATENATION
  
// --- example üëáüëá
                            // ---- [Card] wrapper component ----
                            import "./Card.scss";

                            const Card = (props) => {
                              console.log(props.children);

                              const classes = `card ${props.className}`;

                              return <div className={classes}>{props.children}</div>;
                            };

                            export default Card;


                            // ---- [ExpenseItem] component ----
                            import ExpenseDate from "./ExpenseDate";
                            import Card from "./Card";
                            import "./ExpenseItem.scss";

                            const ExpenseItem = (props) => {
                              return (
                                <Card className="expense-item"> // 'className' values will be availabe to '<Card> </Card>' wrapper element through 'props.className'
                                  //  [content that will be available through 'props.children']
                                </Card>
                              );
                            };

 /   Listening to Events & working with Event Handlers in React

 - On ALL built-in/native HTML elements (ie: <div></div>) ‚≠ê[NOT custom HTML elements (ie: <Card></Card>)]‚≠ê, we have full access to the native DOM events which we can listen to.
                                                                                                              // List of HTML DOM Events: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp
                                                           
 - Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences: -> 
            
          1. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase (ie: 'onClick={}'.)
          2. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
          
     „Ä∞ So instead of doing this, like in Vanilla JavaScript (Imperative Approach) -->  document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', funciton() { ... }); 
                                This üëÜ would be imperative code, we're not using React's features with this code and you would trigger some function that lives outside of React components and hence                                     wouldn't be able to interact with React component state.

     „Ä∞ We simply add an inline HTML DOM event, of the event we want to listen to, to the HTML element in the JSX code. As shown below üëá
                                       -- in HTML -->  <button onclick="activateLasers()"> Activate Lasers </button>

                                       -- in React --> <button onClick={activateLasers}> Activate Lasers </button>  

üõë IMPORTANT: We dont add parentheses to the event Handler function, because we DONT want to execute it in the JSX code, we just want to point at it so that it gets called whenever we click the button. If we do add parentheses to it then JavaScript will execute it as the component's JSX code is being parsed, NOT as we click the button itself. Nothing would happen if we click the button.

    „Ä∞ We then create a funciton that will get executed when the event is triggered üëá
              const activateLasers = (event) => {
                event.preventDefault(); // if we need to prevent default behavior of an element
                console.log('Pew Pew üöÄ')
              };

 / What are HOOKS in React

 - Hooks are FUNCTIONS that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
                „Ä∞ We call such components 'function components' because they are literally JavaScript functions. 
                „Ä∞ Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes ‚Äî they let you use React without classes.
                        With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a                                   Class component in React.
                  

 - Hooks functions start with 'use' keyword (ie: 'useState')

 - Two main Rules for React Hooks: 
            1. Make sure to not use Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Because Hooks must always run in the same order, in every component render.
                           MUST be in TOP LEVEL of our 'function component' with nothing around them. 
                           
            2. We can ONLY use Hooks inside React Function components. 
                           Cant use them in Class components (ie: class App extends React.Component { ... } ), because classes already have their own way to do things that Hooks do.

üìù SIDE NOTE -> A component function is a function that return JSX code.

 / 'State' concept in React
 
 - In object-oriented programming, the 'state' of an object is the combination of the original values in the object plus any modifications made to them. 

 - 'State' is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.
                It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function)

/ ==============================================================================================================================================================================================
// -------------------------------------------------------------
 / 'useState()' Hook                   [Most IMPORTANT react hook]

 - A component needs 'state' when some data associated with it, changes over time. 
      For example, a Checkbox component might need isChecked in its state, and a NewsFeed component might want to keep track of fetchedPosts in its state.
         
 - The most important difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself.
      A component cannot change its props, but it can change its state.

 - The 'useState()' hook allows React developers to update, handle and manipulate state inside functional components without needing to convert it to a class component. 
 
 - To use hooks in React, we use NAMED imports, to extract/destructure functions from the React library  --> "import React, { useState } from 'react'"
 
 -- Lets say we want to change an element on the page as we click a button. Inorder to do so we would need to rerun/rerender the component function for that ELEMENT, that we want to change, inorder for the change to appear in the browser. The is where 'useState()' hook comes in. It allows us to rerun/rerender a Component function when its 'state' changes, ‚≠ê NOT the whole page, just the component inwhich 'useState' hook is being used in ‚≠ê. 
 
      - 'useState()' hook takes in ONE argument which is the INITIAL STATE or default state of the element. (ie: 'useState((initialState))')
      - It then returns an array with two elements, which we can use destructuring to extract them from the Array. 
                    „Ä∞ FIRST element is our CURRENT state, at every iteration of the render component. 
                    „Ä∞ SECOND element is a function which we can call to set a new value to CURRENT state. Calling that function will also trigger React to re-evaluate/re-render the component. It creates a completely NEW state and DOESNOT UPDATE the Current State.

                                  üåü IMPORTANT -> everytime we CALL the update funciton (second variable üëÜ) 
                                                        1. The CURRENT state value (First variable) changes. [doesnt change right away tho, instead React SCHEDULES it to change.]
                                                        2. And then the function component gets RERENDERED or gets executed again (react calls the function again), with the new state of the component.
                                                                This is how we can see changes in the browser.
                                  
                        üí® So in short, when the state of the component changes, 'useState' hook rerenders the component function.
                        
                        üí® We setup 'useState' like this -> 'const [{current state}, {state update function}] = useState({initial state})'  or  'const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title)'


            -----------
          üõëüõë IMPORTANT -> „Ä∞„Ä∞ React keeps track of the component funciton 'CURRENT state' variables and ensures they stay up-to-date on subsequent re-renders of the component.
                                (trust me when I say this ‚Äî that is some JavaScript closures magic happening there). 
                              
                            „Ä∞„Ä∞ React does NOT RE-ASSIGN/override the the 'CURRENT state' value, in a given component instance, as it re-renders the component. It just keeps track of it somewhere under                                 the hood (closures?), and then when the component is re-rendered, the latest 'CURRENT state' is fetched from React, wherever it is stored. So we always get a new                                         snapshot of the 'CURRENT  state' when the component function re-executes. 
                            
                                Which is why we can use 'const' when destructuring 'useState({initial state})' because the 'CURRENT state' never gets reassigned/overriden in the function component.
                      
                            „Ä∞„Ä∞  React also keeps track of when we call 'useState()' hook/function, in a given component instance. 
                                 By doing so, React uses the 'initial state' value as the 'CURRENT state', only ‚≠êONCE‚≠ê, which is when the component is rendered for THE FIRST TIME. After that React                                    uses the 'CURRENT state', which it keeps track of with every state change, as it re-renders the function component, and ignores the 'initial state' value.   
                                 This is why the 'initial state' value does not override the new 'CURRENT state' value everytime we re-render the function component.

          2. Or we could be updating the state of the component function due to a timer getting expired, using 'setTimout()' for example.
          3. Another use case, is to store our component state variable inorder to detach it from the component function, so that when the component funciton is re-rendered, the state variable is stored and survives (ie: the data/state variable is not lost due to React storing it for us somewhere, under the hood).
 
    And many more other use cases.
    
    
    
//---------
// Having multiple 'useState()' function in a component. 
}
    / [2 WAYS -- Depends on personal Preference]
    
1. We can call 'useState()' more than once in a component function, to manage different states of the component üëá [VERY COMMON IN REAL WORLD APP]   {üåü USE THIS üåü}

   // --- Example --- 
      const ExpenseForm = () => {
        const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
        const [amount, setAmount] = useState("");
        const [date, setDate] = useState("");
        
        const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
          setTitle(event.target.value);
        };

        const amountChangeHandler = (event) => {
          setAmount(event.target.value);
        };

        const dateChangeHandler = (event) => {
          setDate(event.target.value);
        };


        return (<div> ... <div/>);
      };


2. Using 'useState()' once to store/manage multiple states, but using an OBJECT as an argument. Inside that OBJECT argument, we can group together our multiple states.
        The difference between this way and the first way, is that whenever we want to update one of the states/keys in the object, we HAVE TO update ALL of the other states/keys as well (even if we           dont want to update their state to a new value). If we dont, React will not merge the other states/keys to the current state , and they will be lost.
               
        In short, the object entered as an argument in 'useState({...})' gets replaced everytime we re-render the component function with a new state, so we have to ensure that we include all the states/keys in the Object as we change the state of the component function.
        
        We can use the spread operator (...), to include all the states/keys in the object, and then override the state that we want to change in the Object, as shown in the example below üëá
                                    
   // --- Example ---           
        const ExpenseForm = () => {
          // üü† Another way of handling multiple states, but using one 'useState()' function
          const [enteredInput, setEnteredInput] = useState({
            enteredTitle: "",
            enteredAmount: "",
            enteredDate: "",
          });
          
          console.log(enteredInput.enteredTitle);
          console.log(enteredInput.enteredAmount);
          console.log(enteredInput.enteredDate);

          const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
            // üü† Updating one state using other way --> have to include other states/keys in the object as well.
            setEnteredInput((prevState) => {
              console.log(prevState);
              return { ...prevState, enteredTitle: event.target.value };
            });
          };

          const amountChangeHandler = (event) => {
            // üü† Updating one state using other way --> have to include other states/keys in the object as well.
            setEnteredInput((prevState) => {
              return {
                ...prevState,
                enteredAmount: event.target.value,
              };
            });
          };

          const dateChangeHandler = (event) => {
            // üü† Updating one state using other way --> have to include other states/keys in the object as well.
            setEnteredInput((prevState) => {
              return {
                ...prevState,
                enteredDate: event.target.value,
              };
            });
          };


          return (<div> ... <div/>);
        };   


// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     / üü† CORRECT way of updating a state based on the **PREVIOUS state**.
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> Whenever we update a state while we are dependent on the previous state (as in the example below), we should pass in a function inside the updating state function:
        
                                // -- üü¢üü¢üü¢ --
                                  setEnteredInput((prevState) => {                // üåüüåü 'prevState' argument return an object containing the previus state/states of the component funtion.
                                    ...prevState,

                      [Safer way to ensure that we always operate on the latest state snapshot. So use this function syntax whenever our state update is dependant on the previous state]

                We do it like this because React scedules state updates, it doesnt perform them instantly. So if we schedule alot of state updates at the same time, we could be dependant on an outdated or incorrect state, when updating to the new state. So dont use this approach üëá use that approach instead üëÜ, where we pass in a function as an argument inside the update state function

                              // -- üî¥üî¥üî¥ --
                                setEnteredInput({
                                  ...enteredInput,
                                  enteredTitle: event.target.value,
                                });  

                              // -- üî¥üî¥üî¥ -- another example of how to NOT update the state of a component based on the previous component's state
                                const [counter, setCounter] = useState(1);
                                ...
                                setCounter(counter + 1);

 / Passing Props/Data From *CHILD to PARENT* Component [UP] in React.js

- üü†üü† ‚≠ê Remember, 'props' is used to pass data from PARENT to CHILD [[DOWN]] only, and NOT the other way around (CHILD to PARENT).
                          So the parent component passes props to the child component and the child can then access the data from the parent via 'props' argument, in the component function.
                          
                          
                          // passing data from PARENT to CHILD -  example üëá

                                      const data = 'Data from parent';

// ----------- üåüüåü VERY IMPORTANT PATTERN in React üåüüåü -------------
 - üü°üîµüü¢üî¥ Passing the data from the CHILD to PARENT component [UP] is a bit trickier. In order to do this, we need to do the following steps:

                    1. Create a callback function in the parent component. This callback function will get the data from the child component.
                    2. Pass the callback function in the parent as a prop to the child component.
                    3. The child component calls the parent callback function using props.
  
                  
                 // passing data from CHILD to PARENT -  example üëá
                    
                                import React from 'react';

                                      // gets submitted data from child component 'ExpenseForm.js'
                                      const getData = (enteredData) => {
                                        const data = {
                                          ...enteredData, // pull all key/value pairs from passed in argument
                                          id: Date.now().toString(), // generate random id

  / Lifting State Up.    [Passing data/state between SIBLING components through a common Parent]       // Same as above üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ but explained further       ////// IMPORTANT //////

                    // Look at 'Lifting State Up' image

- üåü We can ONLY communicate/pass data from PARENT to CHILD, and from CHILD to PARENT. 
                          üõëüõë We CANNOT communicate/pass data between SIBLING components üõëüõë.   [No direct connection between two sibling components]

- So inorder to communicate between sibling components, we pass the data to the parent component that has direct or indirect access to both sibling components, and then pass that data to another child component, that needs that data. 
                                    (ie of commonn Parent is: both sibling components are being rendered by the same parent component)

- We do so by, Passing data (state) from CHILD to PARENT component [UP], as shown in previous section example/explanation üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ And then from PARENT to CHILD component (sibling of other component that passed the data to parent).


           -----
        ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê In short, 'Lifting State Up' is about moving data from a CHILD component to some PARENT component, to either use that data in the PARENT component, or pass it down to some other CHILD                   component and use it there. 
        
                So we lift the data high enough in the component tree (from a Child component to a Parent component), until we reach a parent component that has access to both sibling components (for instance: a child component that generates data and a child a component that needs that data, which both have or share the same parent component, directly or indirectly).

 /  'Controlled' components vs 'Uncontrolled' components in React            / üõëüöè `[INTERVIEW Question ]` üõëüöè

- When talking about 'Controlled' components vs 'Uncontrolled' components in React, we are ussually referring to ***FORM*** elements such as '<input>', '<textarea>', and '<select>'.

                      ---- [üåü USE üü¢ 'Controlled' components [using 'useState'] üü¢, instead of ‚õî 'Uncontrolled' components [using 'useRef'] ‚õî üåü] ----

-- 'Controlled' components: üëá           --- ['useState' hook] ---             
                    1. In React, 'Controlled' Components are those in which the form‚Äôs data is handled by the component‚Äôs state. 
                    2. An '<input>' form element whose value is controlled by React is called a 'Controlled' component.
                    3.  React handles 'Controlled' component form data through state ('useState' hook). It updates that state on every keystroke. And then feed that state back to the '<input>' form                           element, through the 'value' prop. So we can use 'setState' to reset the 'value' prop on an '<input>' element after submitting the form.
                                         Hence, these '<input>' form elements are called 'Controlled' components because their internal state is controlled by React.

-- 'Uncontrolled' components: üëá           --- ['useRef' hook] ---
                    1. In an 'Uncontrolled' component, form data is handled by the DOM itself, and we can acces the values of that data through the 'useRef' hook.
                    2. To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, we can use a 'ref' prop in the HTML element, with the 'useRef' hook, to get form                        values from the DOM. 
                    3. The approach of using 'ref' prop with the 'useRef' hook to interact with DOM elements, specifically with Input elements, is called 'Uncontrolled' components, inwhich we access                          DOM element values with 'ref' attribute and 'useRef' hook. 
                    4. Because the form input data/values internal state, is NOT controlled by React, it is called an 'Uncontrolled' component. 
                       We rely on the default behavior of the input element, where the user enters data in the input, and we then just fetch it using the 'useRef' hook, but we dont feed data back into                        the input element, like we do with 'useState' hook.
                                     (ie: ' <input type="text" ref={usernameRef} /> ') --> is an Uncontrolled component.

 /  Stateless vs Stateful components           ---- IMPORTANT PATTERN ----

- 'Stateful' components are components that manages some state, inside their component function, using the 'useState()' hook. 


- 'Stateless' (dumb) components are components that does NOT manage any state, inside their component function. 
                      Also called presentational or Dumb components because it doesnt have any internal state, it just outputs some data to th user.  


        -------- ‚≠ê‚≠ê In most React applications, we will have *MORE* 'Stateless' (dumb) components than 'Stateful' (smart) component ‚≠ê‚≠ê --------
                      Because only a few components manages states and then distributes those states to 'Stateless' componets through 'props', which then 'Stateless' components output these states

 / Rendering elements dynamically, based on an Array of data 
  
   
   - Use curly braces '{}' because we want to execute a dynamic expression in JSX code.
   
   - Use '.map()' array method to loop over the data array and render elements based on the data in the array.
             We use the '.map()' method because it returns an array of items which React can then render to the screen whereas the '.forEach()' method just loops over the elements in the array withour returning anything. 
             
    ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> If we have an Array of custom elements in our JSX code (ie: '{[<Card />, <Card />]}' ), React is capable of rendering these elements in the array, individually side-by-side, even tho they are in an Array. Which is why we use the '.map()' method which returns an array of elements.
    
    
    // ---- Example ---- 

const App = () => {

  const expenses = [
    {
      id: "e1",
      title: "Toilet Paper",
      amount: 94.12,
      date: new Date(2020, 7, 14),
    },
    {
      id: "e2",
      title: "New LED UHD TV",
      amount: 799.49,
      date: new Date(2021, 2, 12),
    },
    {
      id: "e3",
      title: "Car Insurance",
      amount: 294.67,
      date: new Date(2021, 2, 28),
    },
    {
      id: "e4",
      title: "New Desk (Wooden)",
      amount: 450,
      date: new Date(2021, 5, 12),
    },
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <Expenses expenses={expenses}></Expenses>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;

const Expenses = (props) => {

  return (
    <Card className="expenses">
      
      {props.expenses.map((expense) => {
        const expense_Item = (

 / "Key" prop in React


- React has a special concept when it comes to rendering lists of data, which is the 'key' attribute/prop in custom React elements or built-in HTML elements. 
        A concept that exists to ensure that React is able to update and render such lists efficiently without performance loses or bugs which may occur.

- The 'key' attribute helps React identify these individual items in the list/Array.  
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside an array to give the elements a stable identity.

- 'key' attribute/prop values used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don‚Äôt need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays

- üåü If we dont add a unique 'key' to every list item that we render on the screen (from an array ), then React will render/add the new item at the end of the list (in the DOM) and then RE-RENDER ALL of the elements in the list (in the DOM), inorder make them match the order inwhich the elements are arranged in the Array (in JSX code).       ---- Very bad for performance ----

- üåü Also if some of the rendered array elements have their own state, then that state will be LOST when the DOM elements are re-rendered to match the order of the array in JSX code. 
                    ---- Which could cause alot of bugs ----

- We can always add the 'key' prop to either custom elements or built-in HTML elements in React

- We can use any Primitive value as a unique Identifier. Any number, string etc....
            ‚õî DONT use the index of the an array element as a unique ID ‚õî


// ---- Exmaple
      props.expenses.map((expense, expense_Index) => {
        const expense_Item = (
          <ExpenseItem
            key={expense.id}
            title={expense.title}
            amount={expense.amount}
            date={expense.date}
          />
        );

        return expense_Item;
      })




‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê In short --> ALWAYS add 'key' attributes with unique values to list of items in React. 
                    Gnerate unique value using ( 'Date.now().toString()' ) which generates a random id.
                           ‚õî DONT use the index of the an array element as a unique ID ‚õî

 / Adding Dynamic STYLING to elements in JSX    [‚õî DONT USE ‚õî]

- We can add styling dynamically in JSX code by using the 'style' attribute. 'style' attribute works a but differently when building a React application.

- The value of the 'style' attribute will be dynamic, so wrapped around curly braces 'style={}' .

- Then the 'style' attribute in React takes in a ‚≠ê JAVASCRIPT OBJECT ‚≠ê as a value, with the styling element styling inside as key/value pairs. 
                    - 'keys' are the CSS property names 
                             -- in camelCase without quotation -> '(style={{backgroundColor: props.elementColor}})' [USE THIS]
                             -- OR, with the actual CSS property name with quotations (string) ->     '( style={{"background-color": props.elementColor}}) ')
                    - 'values' are the CSS property values.
                              (ie: 'style={{height: props.elementHeight, backgroundColor: 'red'}}' attribute)

// Example: 
        <div
          className="chart-bar__fill"
          style={{ height: barFill_Height }}
        ></div>

    -- Conditional & Dynamic Styling
    -- üåüüåü Two popular appraches for SCOPING styles to Components. (setting up styles that only affect a certain component, and is not added as Global CSS)
                          1. Using 'Styled Components' approach. A popular Third-party library that allows us to setup PRE-STYLED components with their own scoped styles.
                          2. Using 'CSS Modules' approach.
                          
- ‚≠ê REMEMBER -- IMPORTANT -> The linked CSS file (import './ExpenseItem.css') styling is NOT SCOPED to just the JS component function they are linked to. They are available GLOBALLY.

  / -- 'styled-components' library/package   --->   [Approach 1 for scoped component styling]        [üåüüåü prefer 'CSS modules' over 'styled-components'. DONT USE??üåüüåü]
 

- ‚≠ê REMEMBER -- IMPORTANT -> The linked CSS file (import './ExpenseItem.css') styling is NOT SCOPED to just the JS component function they are linked to. They are available GLOBALLY. 

                üééüéç Its totally fine. But it might cause bugs when alot of developers are working on the same project and duplicate css class names are accidently created. 
                      Which is why we use scoped component styling.
                
                      
   - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The 'Styled Components' library helps us build components which have certain styles attached to them. Where the styling is scoped to the component its attached to. Cant access those styles on any other component in the App.
   
   
   - „Ä∞ Installing 'Styled Components' library üëá
                1. cd to project folder
                2. run -> 'npm install --save styled-components'

   - 'Styled Components' uses 'Tagged template literals' which is a default JavaScript feature.

// --------------------------------------------------------------
 /`  What are 'Tagged template literals'? `     [üòµ Confusing üòµ. No need to understand in depth] 
 
      'Tagged template literals' offers the opportunity to parse template literals in whatever way you want. 
      It works by combining functions with template literals. 
      There are two parts of a tagged template literal, the first one being the tag function and the second, the template literal.
    
// --------------------------------------------------------------  
 
      
 -- const Button = styled.button``; 
                / In this React component function (created using 'Styled Components' library) üëÜ:
        - 'button' is a special kind of method that instead of using parentheses '()', it uses backticks '``', which is a special kind of syntax called 'Tagged template literals'. 
        - 'button' is being used as a method on the 'styled' Object ('styled' object is imported from the 'Styled Components' library)
        - In the end, ' styled.button`` ' will be executed as a method behind the scenes.
        - What we pass in between the backticks, will be passed to the ' button`` ' method, in a special way.
        
        - üåü IMPORTANT -> then ' button`` ' method will then return a NEW '<Button>' component. ('Styled Components' library has methods for ALL HTML elements. ie: ' p`` ' method, ' h1`` ' method, etc...)
        - So a ' .button`` ' method returns a button element. An ' .h1`` ' method returns an h1 element. etc.....

        
      - üîµüü¢ So in 'const Button = styled.button``;':
                     1. 'button``' metod will return a '<Button>' custom element.
                     2. The styling specified in between the backticks ' `` ', will be attached to the returned Button element as scoped styling. 
                     3. The returned button is then stored in the 'Button' variable.
                     4. üåüüåüüåü The returned button also has all the 'props' passed to the component function's custom element. Cannot console.log() it?
      

      - üü§üü† 'Styled Components' syntax: 
                     1. " import styled from 'styled-components'; " --> in every component file that uses 'Styled Components' library.
                     2. Styling between backticks does NOT take in selectors/classes (ie: ‚õî '.button { ... }' ‚õî)
                     3. It is similar to Sass in a way that we can use '&' to style psuedo-elements (ie: '&:hover', '&:focus'),  or target a child element (ie: '& input')
                     


// --------------------------------------------------------------
/`  How does 'Styled Components' make the styling SCOPED to the returned element??   `
      'Styled Components' make the styling SCOPED to the returned element, by dynamically generating and adding unique classes to the returned element, that are not shared by any other elements in the app.
      So in the end the styling is available GLOBALLY, but with unique classes that are dynamically assigned to elements that the styling belong to. Inorder to avoid accidently spilling styles to other components.

// ---------- `
  2. Another feature of 'styled-components' is adding 'props' to our styled-components, and then utilize thos 'props' inside the backticks in the 'styled-components' function. [ prefer this as well]
           

    - since we are between backticks ' `` ', we can use template literal syntax '${}'.
    - And inside '${}' , 'styled-components' lets us pass in an arrow-function which takes in 'props' as an argument. 
    - 'props' argument will contain all the 'props' passed into the styled-component custom element (ie: ' <FormControl inValid={!isValid}>'), which we can then use to dynamically/conditionally style the component depending on the 'props' value (true or false).

// see example below üëá

  / -- 'CSS Modules'  --->   [Approach 2 for scoped component styling]                  [üåüüåü prefer this over 'styled-components' üåüüåü]

  
  - A CSS Module is a CSS file that defines class and animation names that are scoped locally by default

  - üåü Prefer 'CSS Modules' because I like the seperation between CSS and JavaScript. And like having clean JavaScript files without CSS in them. 
                   üåü Best of both worlds  -> We have our styles in their own CSS files, but they are still scoped to the components where we import them. 
                                              By having unique dynamically generated classes, which contain our styles.

  - 'CSS Modules' is only available in projects that are configured to support it, because it needs a code transformation that need to be done, before the code runs in the browser.

  - React apps are already configured to use 'CSS Modules'

-- Using 'CSS Modules' in React: üëá
        1. Rename the component's CSS file to be like this --> 'Button.module.css'
        2. instead of importing CSS files to component function like this -> " import './Button.css' ",
           inorder to use 'CSS Modules' we import the CSS file like this  -> " import styles from './Button.module.css' "       
                        
                              / NOTE:  -- 'styles' is an object generated by 'CSS Modules', which can be named to anything we want. 
                                       -- The 'styles' object contains all the classes in the 'Button.module.css' file, as properties
                                       
        3. Inorder to use the styling in the 'styles' object we dynamically add the class to the element, like so üëá
   
                              import React from "react";

                              // importing 'CSS Module' file
                              import styles from "./Button.module.css";

                              // console.log(styles);

                              const Button = (props) => {
                                return (                               üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá
                                  <button type={props.type} className={styles.button} onClick={props.onClick}>
                                    {props.children}
                                  </button>
                                );
                              };

                              export default Button;

    // ----
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> if the class name has a dash (ie: 'form-control') using it like this ' className={styles.form-control} ', will give us an error
                           So we can use a different syntax to access that class through CSS modules like so --> ' className={styles['form-control']} '
                                            BECAUSE STRINGS are VALID KEYS in JavaScrip OBJECTS.

  / Fragements, Protals, & "Refs"


- 'Fragements' ['<React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>' OR '<> </>'] let us group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

- 'Portals' lets us render elements somewhere else in the DOM, than it would normally go to.

- "Refs" provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.


// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -------------------------------------------------------------
  / -- 'Fragments' 

- JSX limitations üëá: (See Images in 'React Notes' folder)
      
      1. We can NOT return more than one "root" JSX element. We also can NOT store more than one "root" JSX element in a variable.
                      Solutions:            1. Wrap the adjacem JSX elements with an custom element or a built-in HTML element (As we've been doing).
                                               üõëüöèüõë Problem --> is that we can end up with a "<div> Soup". Where we have UNNECESSARY DIVs bring rendered in the DOM ONLY because of this JSX                                                                             limitation inwhich we can only have ONE root element. 
                                                                - üëÜ Not good practice because we are rendering too many (unnecessary elements) which makes our app slower. 
                                                                - Another problem with unnecessary div wrappers in the DOM, is that it might break our styling, if nested CSS selectors are used.
                                                                                                                                
                                            2. Put all the JSX elements in an Array, (each JSX element in  its own spot, seperated by commas), this is because React can render elements in Arrays just                                                like with the 'map()' method which returns an array of elements that React can render to the DOM. Each JSX element will need to have a unique key tho.                                                   [‚õî DONT USE ‚õî]

                                            3. A Trick we can use is -> Creating a <Wrapper> custom element, that return 'props.children', then wrapping our other components with it. This won't create                                                unnecessary elements in the DOM. Like so: 

                                                              const Wrapper = (props) => {
                                                                return props.children;
                                                              };

                                                              export default Wrapper;
                                                      / --------

                                                              function App() {
                                                                return (
                                                                  <Wrapper>
                                                                    <UserForm onSubmitUserData={submitUserDataHandler} />

                                                                    <UserList userData={userData} />
                                                                  </Wrapper>
                                                                );
                                                              }

                                            4. üåüüåüüåüüåü Best solution is using either '<React.Fragment>' or Fragmenents '<> </>'  --> 
                                                                          '<React.Fragment>' --> Works on all projects. Will always work.

                                                                                       Can be used the same way you‚Äôd use any other element except that it doesn‚Äôt support keys or attributes.

  / -- 'Portals'

- 'Portals' provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node, that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

- Lets us render elements somewhere else in the DOM, than it would normally go to. 
          (ie: if a '<Modal />' custom element is rendered inside a '<form>' element for some reason, it might still work fine due to styling, but it is not good practice in terms of accessibility)


- Using Portals -> 
                    1. Create the 'container' elements in the 'index.html' file located in the 'public' folder.
                                              (ie: '<div id="modal-root"><div/>')  ['container' DOM element should have an 'id' with a value like so -> ' id="{anyName}-root" ']

                    2. Go to the modal component function file and import the 'react-dom' package inorder to use the 'createPortal' method available in it.  (ie: ' import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; ')
                    (See explanation above for what 'react-dom' package is).                                                       
                    
                    3. The 'createPortal()' method needs two argumemts -> 'ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)'

                                                -- SECOND, argument 'container' is a pointer to the 'container' DOM element, inwhich we want to render the 'child' DOM element in.

      /` üìù SIDE NOTE: - ussually we dont need to use ' document.getElementById('...') ' or document.querySelector('...'), etc.. in React (instead we use 'ref' attribute and 'useRef' Hook). But in this case we DO need to use it.
                       - Also wherever we would normally use a components in JSX (<Modal />), we can use 'ReactDOM.createPortal()' method instead to make the component element render somewhwere else                            in the DOM

  / 'useRef' Hook and 'ref' attribute

                                        ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The equivalent of the 'document.querySelector()' method in React is using 'refs' and 'useRef()' hook. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


- 'refs' are powerful. In their most basic form, they allow us to gain access to other DOM elements and work with them. 

- üß® The 'ref' attribute can only be used on built-in HTML elements. 
          Inorder to use 'ref' on component function elements, we need to use 'React.forwardRef()' method && 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook, which is covered later. 

- üõë It is bad practice to access DOM directly when using React. (ie: ' document.getElementById("myInput").focus() ').
                          Therefore, we use 'useRef()' hook along with 'ref' attribute on Built-in HTML elements           [üåü cant use 'ref' attribute on custom function elements]



- 'useRef' key features: üëá
                  1. Remember, like all React Hooks, 'useRef' is only usable/functional INSIDE React component functions.
                  
                  2. Using 'useRef' ->  -- 'useRef' returns a mutable Object with a 'current' property that is initialised with the value of the argument passed into the 'useRef()' Hook. 
                                                           (ie: 'initialValue' in -> ' const refContainer = useRef(initialValue); ')

                                        -- We can then use the 'ref' prop, available on ALL HTML elements inside JSX code, to CONNECT the HTML element to one of the specified 'useRef' variables. 
                                                               [very often used in INPUT elements, when we just want to FETCH/READ input data, nothing more]
                                                                   example: '<input type="text"  ref={refContainer} .> '

                                        -- üåüüåü Using 'ref' prop on an HTML element will set the 'current' property value of that 'useRef' hook, to the CORRESPONDING DOM node whenever that node **CHANGES**. üåüüåü       
                                                          üßµ IMPORTANT -> So what will end-up as a value of the 'current' property, is a DOM Node itself which contains a value of the element.
                                                          
                                                From there we can acces the 'value' property available on ALL DOM nodes to get the value of the connected HTML element. 
                                                    (ie: 'refContainer.current.value') üåüüåü
                                        
                                        -- üî¥üî¥üî¥ One things to note is that it is not good practice to manipulate the 'value' property of a DOM element using 'useRef' üî¥üî¥üî¥
                                                    (like so -> ' refContainer.current.value = 0 ').     
                                        If we want to manipulate the 'value' property of that connected DOM Node, use 'useState' instead. One exception tho inwhich its fine, is if we want to reset                                         an '<input>' value after we read it using 'useRef'. 
                                                ‚≠ê So RARELY use 'useRef' to manipulate the DOM ‚≠ê
                                       

- Keep in mind that 'useRef' doesn‚Äôt notify you when its content changes. Mutating the 'current' property doesn‚Äôt cause a re-render.

- üìù SideNote: 'ref' attribute can only be used on built-in HTML elements. And NOT on component function elements. ie: ‚õî ' <Login ref={loginRef} />' ‚õî -->  WILL NOT WORK

- SUMMARY --> use 'useRef' Hook instead of 'useState', when we just want to read a value without changing anything or re-render that component.

- using 'useState' to just read the current value of input elements, for example, is not the best solution because it re-renders the whole components everytime the input value changes. Whereas 'useRef' just lets us read the value and thats it.

  / What are 'Side Effects' also called 'Effect'?
    
    
 - 'Side effects' are basically anything that affects something outside of the scope of the current function that‚Äôs being executed. 
  
            In React, component functions main job is to --> ' Render the UI & React to User Input '
                                                                ie: 1. Evaluate & Render JSX code
                                                                    2. Manage State & Props
                                                                    3. React to (User) events & Input
                                                                    4. Re-evaluate Component function upon State & Prop Changes

 üåüüåüüåü So anything else other than these tasks üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ in React are called 'Side Effects' or 'Effects'. 
                                                                ie: 1. Storing data in browser storage
                                                                    2. Sending Http Requests to Backend Servers
                                                                    3. Setting & Managing timers
                                                                    4. etc...
                                                                    
          ‚≠ê Thus these 'Side Effects' tasks must be done OUTSIDE of the our React component function and render cycle -- especially because they might block/delay rendering due to Http requests.
                                                                1. Remember, React component functions gets re-rendered whenever a state in the component changes. 
                                                                   It re-executes the component function's JSX CODE inorder to check for the new result of that component function and compare it to the                                                                    previous result of the function. Then apply those changes to the real DOM.

  / 'useEffect' hook         ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê [Besides 'useState', 'useEffect' hook is one of the most important hooks in React] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
  
              [Handles 'Side Effect' or 'Effects' AFTER the component function render is committed to the screen]

/` üìù See --> 'react-user-authentication-app' project where 'useEffect' hook is used. `
  
- The 'useEffect' hook lets run some additional code after React has updated the DOM.                        

- using 'useEffect' hook --> ' useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies]) '           

                         - The 'useEffect' hook takes in two arguments:
                                          1. The FIRST argument, is a function that will be executed AFTER the component is evaluated/rendered to the screen. 
                                              (After every evaluation of the component)
                                                 
                                          2. The SECOND argument *[OPTIONAL]*, is an array of dependencies that allow the 'useEffect' hook to execute only if any of those dependencies change,                                                      otherwise it wont.
                                              
                                              / `‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> Dependencies are external variables that is no inside the hook.`
                                          
                                          
        ‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> - By default, 'useEffect' hook runs after every completed render. 

                          - üîµ If we specify an empty array in the second argument, ie: if we leave it empty and DONT specifiy any dependencies, then the 'useEffect' first argument function 
                                (called "Side Effect" function) will only run 'ONCE' when the component is rendered for the first time.  
                                            -- So the 'useEffect' first argument function, will only run 'ONCE' when the app startsup for the first time. And thats it. --
                                                                (ie: ' useEffect(() => { console.log("This will only run once") }, [] '))
                                            
                                          üëÜ USED WHEN --> we want some code to run only 'ONCE' when the component starts-up/mounts for the first time. üëÜ
                                                



                          - üü° If we do specify dependencies in the second argument, then the 'useEffect' hook first argument function will get executed everytime any of the specified dependencies change.

/ 'useEffect' hook WITH Dependencies `

- We often DO need to specify dependencies in the 'useEffect' hook, because we dont want 'useEffect' to only run once when the app starts-up for the first time. 
      But after every component re-rerender, if any specified dependencies change.

- 'useEffect' hook is a very important hook, that lets us execute certain code, is response to something. 
                        In addition to the 'Side Effects' mentioned above. That something could be: 
                                                               1. The component being loaded for the first time. 
                                                               2. An '<input>' value (state) being updated by user input.
                                                               3. etc...
                  So for-instance we can use it to re-execute a component funciton using 'setState', inresponse to a 'state' being changed. Even tho this is not one of the 'Side Effects' mentioned                       above, we can consider it as such. üëáüëáüëá

/ ` Adding Nested Properties As Dependencies To useEffect `
                                                
                                           https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/26043040#questions
                                                
                                                
 - In the previous lecture, we used object destructuring to add object properties as dependencies to 'useEffect()'.

                               ` const { value: someProperty } = someObject;

                                useEffect(() => {
                                  // code that only uses someProperty ...
                                }, [someProperty]); `


 - This is a very common pattern and approach,that is commonly used.

 - The key thing is NOT that we use destructuring but that we pass 'specific properties' instead of the entire object as a dependency.

 - We could also write this code and it would work in the same way.

                                useEffect(() => {
                                  // code that only uses someProperty ...
                                }, [someObject.someProperty]);

                              ` üëÜ This works just fine as well! ‚õî DONT USE ‚õî üëÜ`

 - But we should avoid this code üëÜ:

                                useEffect(() => {
                                  // code that only uses someProperty ...
                                }, [someObject]);

 - Why?
Because now the effect function would re-run whenever 'ANY' property of someObject changes - not just the one property (someProperty in the above example) our effect might depend on.

   There is an optional cleanup mechanism for effects. Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other. They‚Äôre part of the same effect!
                                                
    
If our 'useEffect' returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up.

This cleanup mechanism can be usefull to implement a 'Debounce' Pattern as the user types something in the input field which sends an HTTP request to the backend for a search result for instance.
See below for explanation on what 'Debounce' pattern is üëá.


// ------------
    /` ‚≠ê What is Debaouncing pattern? ‚≠ê`   ' https://skilled.dev/course/debounce '            / `[ INTERVIEW QUESTION ]`

 - Debouncing is a good method for controlling events that require sporadic user actions such as typing in an input field or clicking a button. 
 - In the case of a search bar that makes API calls according to user input, implementing a debounce is a good way to reduce the number of calls made to the API.
      It is a practical solution used in real-world applications to improve performance and demonstrates that you understand the tools to write good code for real users.

 -- A 'debounce' pattern is utilized when you only care about the final state. 
                    For example, waiting until a user stops typing to fetch typeahead search results.
 -- A 'throttle' pattern is best used when you want to handle all intermediate states but at a controlled rate. 
                    For example, track the screen width as a user resizes the window and rearrange page content while it changes instead of waiting until the user has finished.

Common scenarios for a debounce are resize, scroll, and keyup/keydown events. In addition, you should consider wrapping any interaction that triggers excessive calculations or API calls with a debounce.

/ ` 'Debouncing' Pattern using 'useEffect' cleanup function ` 

- We can return something in the 'Side Effect' funciton inside the 'useEffect' hook's 'first argument.
- The returned SOMEHTING needs to be a FUNCTION itself. Can be an anonymous arrow funciton, or a named funciton. The returned function is called the 'Cleanup' function.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The 'Cleanup' function runs (as a cleanup process):
                                  1. *BEFORE* every 'Side Effect' funciton execution 
                                  2. and when the component is REMOVED or ADDEDD to the DOM. ‚≠ê‚≠ê
          üåüüåüüåüüåü It does NOT run before the *FIRST* 'Side Effect' function execution, tho (ie: the 'Cleanup' function does NOT run as the app startsup for the first time).
        

 - With every keystroke we clear the timout. So that we only have one ongoing timer at a time.
          So as long as the user keeps typing, the timer keeps resetting. 
                Once they stop typing, the returned function ('Cleanup' function) gets executed.

  
// ---- example 

                    useEffect(() => {
                      const runLater = setTimeout(() => {
                        setFormIsValid(
                          enteredEmail.includes("@") && enteredPassword.trim().length > 6
                        );
                      }, 500);

                      // -- 'Cleanup' function inside 'Side Effect' function üëá
                      return () => {
                        // - cancels the timeout of previously executed side Effect function (ie: the 'runLater' function) as long as user types
                        clearTimeout(runLater);
                      };
                    }, [enteredEmail, enteredPassword]);

  / 'useReducer' Hook 
  
  
 - The 'useReducer' Hook is similar to the 'useState' Hook.

 - It allows for custom state logic.

 - If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.
 
 - use 'useReducer' hook when: 
                          1. We have multiple states that belong together
                                        ie:     const [enteredEmail, setEnteredEmail] = useState("");            ---- üîµ

                          2. üåü Or if we want to update a state that depends on ANOTHER state.
                                  Inwhich case we can NOT use the function form of 'setState' function. --> ' setAge((previousAge) => previousAge + 1); '

/ ` Using the 'userReducer' hook `


        const [state, dispatchFn] = useReducer(reducerFn, initialState, initFn);

- Just like 'useState', 'userReducer' returns an array with exactly two values.
              So we can use destrucuting to pull out these values and store them in variables.
              
             üí® 'state' --> is the latest 'state' snaphsot
             
             üí® 'dispatchFn' --> a function that allows us to update the 'state' snapshot.  Dispatches an ACTION.
                                     Same as 'useState' hook, with some difference:
                                                    „Ä∞ Instead of just setting a new 'state' value, the 'dispatchFn' function dispatches an ACTION,
                                                                  which will be consumed by the 'reducerFn' function.
                                                    „Ä∞ 'dispatchFn' can have any type as an argument. But as a convention, it is usually an Object:
                                                        1. with a 'type' property with a value of a string in ALL CAPS, that describes the state.
                                                        2. and another property that holds a value of what we want the state to be updated to when we call the 'dispatchFn()' function
                                           ie -> ' dispatchFn({type: "INPUT_VALUE", val: entry.target.value}) '

             üí® 'reducerFn' --> a function that receives two arguments: 
                                              1. the LATEST 'state' snapshot 
                                              2. and the LAST ACTION that was dispatched from the 'dispatchFn' function, which triggered the 'useReducer' function execution. 
                                                          (argument passed into the 'dispatchFn' function)  
                                 üåü Then we should return a newState in the 'reducerFn' function (Could be of any type, Object for instance)
                                 'reducerFn' is usually defined outside of the scope of the component function.
                                 
                                 ie -> ' const dispatchFn => ( [latest state snapshot], ["dispatchFn" argument] ) { return(...) } '   OR     ' const dispatchFn => ( state, action ) { return(...) } '
                                  
             üí® 'initialState' --> Sets an 'initialState' for the 'state' snapshot. 

             üí® 'initFn' --> a function that sets the 'initialState'

  / Context API

- 'Context API' is a component-wide, "behind the scenes" State Stroage.

- The 'Context API' is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from child to parent to GrandParent and then to the child that needs that prop, and so on. So we pass these props to components that dont need or use them, just to reach the component that needs that prop.

- Context is designed to share data that can be considered ‚Äúglobal‚Äù for a tree of React components.

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

- These prop chains could get inconvenient and unmanageable as apps get bigger and bigger.

- 'Context API' allows us to manage states behind the scenes, such that we are able to direclty change those states from any component in our app, and directly pass it to any compoennt in our app, without building a prop chain.


- We can have multiple contexts for multiple global states in our app. Or just one Context that contains all of our global states.



-- üåüüåü Using Context API: 
                      1. Create a folder called 'content' or 'store' in our app. In there add a file called 'auth-context.js' 
                                                    (we added 'auth-' to the file name since we are going to manage an authentication state in that file)
                                                           (Also not in PascalNotation 'AuthCantext.js' since this file wont be storing component)

                                              // ------------

                      2. In 'auth-context.js' file:  
                                        1) We import React (' import React from "react" ')

                                        2) Then create Context Object, which takes in a default context as an argument. The default argument can be anything but is ussually an object.
                                                            (The context Object is our app or component-wide state)
                                                             
                                                                        ie: 'const AuthContext = React.createContext(defaultValue) '

                                        3) ' const AuthContext = React.createContext(defaultValue) ' returns an Object that CONTAINS components, which will be stored in the 'AuthContext' variable.
                                        
                                        4) Then export the 'AuthContext' Object, to make it available in other files/components.
                                        
                                                 ie ->   import React from "react";

                                                         const AuthContext = React.createContext({ isLoggedIn: false });

                                                         export default AuthContext; 
                                               // ------------

                      3. 'Provide' the Context to components that need to have access to it, by wrapping the components JSX code with ' <ContextName.Provider> ... <ContextName.Provider/> '
                  
                              - Tell react to give access to the context, to components that are wrapped by the Context.
                                  To do so -> We wrap all the components that need to access to this Context Object with this ' <ContextName.Provider> ... <ContextName.Provider/> ',                                                 in their returned JSX code. 
                                                             
                                                      
                      ‚≠ê‚≠ê Components wrapped with the ' <ContextName.Provider> ... <ContextName.Provider/> ' will have ACCESS to that Context, along with ALL their DESCENDANT components.                                                                So all their children components, and their children children components, and so on ‚≠ê‚≠ê
                                  The purpose for having a Context Provider wrap around children is to keep track of state and props
                                            
                              - Then specify the values that we want to pass on to components that consumes the Context, using the 'value={ ... }' prop                                                                             available on all ' <ContextName.Provider> '. 



                            ie ->                             function App() {
                                                                const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

                                                                return (
                                                                  <AuthContext.Provider value={{isLoggedIn: isLoggedIn}}>     üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà      
                                                                    <MainHeader isAuthenticated={isLoggedIn} onLogout={logoutHandler} /> 
                                                                    <main>
                                                                      {!isLoggedIn && <Login onLogin={loginHandler} />}
                                                                      {isLoggedIn && <Home onLogout={logoutHandler} />}
                                                                    </main>
                                                                  </AuthContext.Provider>    üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà
                                                                );
                                                              }

                                                              export default App;


                      4. 'Listen' to or 'Consume' the Context in components that need to access the Context Data.
                                There are 'TWO' ways to Listen or Consume the context in components.
                                
      [üî¥ DONT USE üî¥] -->    üí®üí® FIRST way, using ' <ContextName.Consumer> ... <ContextName.Consumer/> '
                                       To get access to the Provided Context values in 'value={ ... }' prop, we need wrap the components that want to consume the context with                                                               ' <ContextName.Consumer> ' which should have an anonymous function inside it as a child. The anonymous function will receive all the properties passed into                                          the 'value={ ... }' prop as an argument which we can then use in the component.

                                    - Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that context.
                                    - The current context value is determined by the 'value={ ... }' prop of the nearest '<MyContext.Provider>' above the calling component in the tree.

      
      
                                   - Don‚Äôt forget that the argument to useContext must be the context object itself. So the Context that we created in the 'contexts' folder.

/ React Context API Limitations

  - React Context is NOT optimized for hight frequency changes. ie: not optimitzed for states that changes every second or even multiple times/second.

  üåü If we DO have a state that needs to be Global and that also changes often we can use REDUX.
  - Redux is a state solution that we generally prefer for big applications. You could very well build a medium scale application with just Context and React Hooks, so you don't really need Redux     for it but you can use it there too.

 /  'Forwarding Refs' technique using --> 'forwardRef()' method && 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook             [RARELY USED --> usefull in reusable component libraries]    
        
                { üòµ confusing topic look at documentation & youtube}
 
                             --- [üõë Wont and shouldnt be used often because its not the typical react pattern, but could be usefull in some cases üõë] ---
   
                ‚≠ê‚≠ê  Inorder to be able to use the 'ref' attribute on 'React component function elements' we need to use the 'forwardRef()' method && 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook  ‚≠ê‚≠ê
 
      // -----                                
  - The 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook allows us to expose a value, state, or function inside a parent component function to the child component element, when using 'ref' attribute in the child component element.
          (should be used with 'forwardRef()')

  üåüüåü Normally, for a parent component to call a function, it must be defined in the parent component and passed down via props to the child component. 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook allows us to break that rule and call a function in the parent component that is defined in the CHILD component.
  
         „Ä∞  HAVE TO use 'useRef()' hook when we are using the 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook, in the PARENT component.
         „Ä∞ 'useImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { ... }})' takes in two arguments: 
                                                      1. FIRST argument is a 'ref' also available in the Parent component funciton as a parameter, IF a 'ref' attribute was to be set on a Child                                                                  component element from the outside. This 'ref' argument will establish the connection between the child component element 'ref' attribute and                                                            the Parent component.
                                                      2. SECOND argument is a funciton that should return an Object. That Object will contain all the data that we can use from OUTSIDE the Parent                                                                component, by the Child component elements via 'useRef()'
             
     // ----- 
  - The 'forwardRef()' method allows parent components to pass down (i.e., ‚Äúforward‚Äù) 'ref' to their children. Using 'forwardRef' in React gives the child component a reference to a DOM element created by its parent component. This then allows the parent to read and modify its child element anywhere it is being used.
        
      „Ä∞ 'forwardRef()' method still returns a React component, but a React component that is capable of being bound to a 'ref'. ie: its child component elements can have/use the 'ref' attribute.
  
 
 - With 'forwardRef()' method && 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook, we can expose functionalities from a parent component to its React component elements (child elements)  

     „Ä∞ Only things that we will be able to use on Child component elements through 'ref' attribute, is what is specified in the 'useImperativeHandle()' Hook second argument function.
  

  - This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries.
  
  - üåü Component functions can have another parameter inaddition to the 'props' parameter, which exists when you define a component with 'React.forwardRef()' call.
                Regular function or class components don‚Äôt receive the 'ref' argument, and ref is not available in props either.
                          The 'ref' parameter in component function --> links the parent element to the child component element through 'ref' attribute. 
                                Which is then passed to 'useImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { ... }})'
                                                                             üëÜüëÜ

  / Using Images and Icons to a React component

     1. Create an 'assets' folder in the 'src' folder, where we will placee all project images.
     2. We can 'import' images in React components, just like we import css files. Its not a JavaScript feature, instead its a React feature. 
            Behind the scenes, when importing CSS files or images -> the 'import' is transformed to include the image in the finished application which we could deploy to a server, then React generates a link to that image                which is then dynamically inserted in the generated code.
            
          So in the component that we want to use the image in üëáüëá


                    import mealsImage from "../../Assets/meals.jpg";

 - ‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT Note -> React will only rerun a component function and re-evaluate it inorder to compare it to the Virtual-DOM, ONLY when a 'state', 'prop' or 'context' changes.
                                                      [all comes to 'state' changes tho, because 'props' and 'context' can only be changed throyugh 'state']
                                After that, ONLY the changes between current real DOM and virtual-DOM are made to the Real DOM.
                                
 - üåü ONLY the component function that manages the 'state' gets re-executed if the 'state' changes. Along with all the child component elements inside it, which causes these child component element's parent component functions to also be re-executed.

/ 'React.memo()' Higher order component  -> Preventing unnecessary Re-evaluations of components with                      [PERFORMANCE Optimization]


                                            ' https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25599594 '

  - A 'Higher-order component' is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
 
  
  - 'React.memo()' is a higher order component. Wrapping a component with 'React.memo()', react will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result. ONLY if the passed in 'props' values does not change.
  
    - 'React.memo()' only checks for 'prop' changes of the wrapped component function. It compares the current props values that the wrapped component function received, with its previous props values. Only if any of the props has changed between executions, then the wrapped component function is re-evaluated.
            So if your function component wrapped in 'React.memo()' has a 'useState', 'useReducer' or 'useContext' Hook in its implementation, it will still rerender when 'state' or 'context' change.
 
    
    
        // example -> 
    
                  const MyComponent = (props) => {
                    /* render using props */
                  }
                  
                  const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {
                    /*
                    return true if passing nextProps to render would return
                    the same result as passing prevProps to render,
                    otherwise return false
                    */
                  }
                  
                  export default React.memo(MyComponent, areEqual);             üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà
                  
                  
// --------- Could prevent weird BUGS --------------
 - üõë‚≠êüöèü§ö VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ‚≠êüöè‚úãüõë -> 'React.memo()' only works on 'props' that have 'Primitive types' as a value (ie: number, string, boolean, ... types), and NOT on 'Reference types' (ie: Objects, arrays, functions, ...) because of the way they are stored in memory. 
 
      Remember -> -- 'Primitive types' are stored in the CALLSTACK. They are also IMMUTABLE. Which means their values cant change. So when a parent component is re-executed, 'props' that has Primitve values DONT change and                         thus the child component function DOESNOT get re-executed when wrapped with 'React.memo()'. 
      
                  -- Whereas 'Reference types' are stored in the HEAP and they are MUTABLE. So whenever the component function is re-executed, a NEW ALLOCATED piece of memory is created in the CALLSTACK which will point to the Object address that is stored in the HEAP. So inshort, if we use a function as a 'prop' value, behind the scenes its a new function with every component funciton re-execution, which is why 'React.memo()' does NOT work with 'Reference types', since they allocate new memory in the CALL STACK with every re-execution of the component function.
// -----------------------
                  
      / `Performance`            
                  
      - üõë NOTE:  This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to ‚Äúprevent‚Äù a render, as this can lead to bugs.

      - The process of comparing 'props' between executions for compoennts wrapped with 'React.memo()', can cause performance issues itself which is why it is not used in all components.
            So it all comes to whether it is worth it to use 'React.memo()' and compare the component's props, or simply let it get re-evaluated everytime its parent it re-evaluated. 

      -- It is worth using 'React.memo()' on a parent component that has alot of performance heavy component functions as children, which does not need to be re-executed whenever their parent is re-executed.
                (called 'branch components')






 // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/   using 'useCallback()' Hook to make 'React.memo()' method work on 'Reference types'



  - 'useCallback()' Hook allows us to STORE 'Reference types' (Objects, arrays, funcitons), across compoennt re-executions. And that function should not be re-executed with every component re-execution.
  
          Stores the function in the same place in memory.

         - If dependencies ARE specified then that means that the function will change whenever a dependency value changes, and thus react will need to recreate and store that new function in its storage inorder use it since            it depends on the changed depenendency.            / `‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> Dependencies are external variables that are NOT inside the hook.`

/ 'state' & Components executions behind the scenes

  - Everything comes down to 'state' when it comes to re-rendering components and changing what on the screen.
  
  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
  / ` Why doesn't the initial state value in the argument passed into 'useState(..)' hook, override the current 'state' value with every re-execution of the component funciton, even tho it gets called with every component         funciton re-execution? `
          (ie: Why doesnt the 'state' get re-initialized with every component function re-execution) 
                      // ' const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false); '

  The reason is that React makes sure that 'useState(defaultValue)' and the defaultValue we pass into it, is only considered ONCE when the component is rendered for the very first time.
      So the very first time the component is rendered, 'useState' creates a new state variable which is handed to and managed by React. React then memorizes which component that 'state' belongs and uses the defaultValue to initialize the 'state' with that value. 
        Then for every re-rerender of the component after the very first render, NO new state is being created, instead React knows that the component already has 'state' variable for that state, which was created in the first render, as a result it just **UPDATES** that 'state' as needed (since the state was already created with the first render of the component).
  
            So the 'state' will only be created when the component function is rendered for the first time, and only if the component was completely removed from the DOM and then re-rendered.   
                    After the first render/initiallization of the component, 'states' in that component are UPDATED whenever the component is re-rendered.

/  Understanding 'state' scheduling 

          ' https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25599626 '

                  Also check image called -> ' Scheduled state change behind the scenes '

  
  - How does React handles 'state' updates
  
        const [showParagraph, setShowParagraph] = useState(false);
  
  - üåüüåü When calling 'setShowParagraph(true);' to change the state of 'showParagraph', the 'showParagraph' state does NOT change immediatly, instead React schedules that state change inorder to execute other performance heavy tasks that React considers to have a higher priority that the state change task.
          Eventually the 'state' will change to the new value, and once it is changed -> the compnent function will be re-executed.
  
  - React guarantees tho that 'state' changes to the same 'state' is executed in the order inwhich they are written in the code.
  
  - üõëüõë Due to the fact that multiple state changes can be scheduled at the same time (or in the same component function execution), it is recommended to use the function form for updating state that is dependant on thew previous state üëáüëáüëáüëá
  
     ' setShowParagraph((prevShowParagraph) => !prevShowParagraph) '



// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ Understanding 'state' Batching


 - React uses batching to group state updates within event handlers and inbuilt hooks. And thus prevents components from re-rendering for EACH state update. 
      This improves application performance.

/ 'useMemo()' Hook             

 / ` Difference between 'useCallback()' and 'useMemo()' Hook `
   'useCallback()' and 'useMemo()' both expect a function and an array of dependencies. The difference is that:
        - 'useCallback()' returns its function when the dependencies change. Caches function type.
        - while 'useMemo()' calls its function and returns the result/value. Caches value type.
   
   
                    We ussually use 'useCallback()' Hook more than 'useMemo()' Hook, because memorizing functions is more useful than memorizing other types of data.
                    
      Might not be worth it to 'useMemo()' on all values, all the time because it occupies some memory and its storing functionality takes up some performance. Unless in example below where we use a performance heavy array method to 'sort()' an array, which would be usefull to only sort once and memorize its value so we dont need to sort it with every re-render.
      
      
      // example

  / Sending Http Requests       (Connecting React Web Applications to a BackEnd & Database)



// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/  How NOT to connect to a Database 


    - ‚õî We should NOT directly connect and fetch data from a Database server using our client-side JavaScript code (React App). 
              Because in doing so we would be exposing our Database credentials to the browser and anyone using the our App can access them. Can also cause performance issues ‚õî
              
    - üü¢ So instead of directly connecting to a Database (SQL, NoSQL, etc...) from inside our React App code:
              1. we always use a Backend Application running on another machine, not running in the browser but some server out there. 
              2. The Backend application can be written with any server-side language of our choice -> (NodeJS App, PHP App, ASP.net etc...).
              3. That Backend application will connect to the Database, because we can safely store and use Database credentials on the Backend application since the backend code cant be viewed in the browser, its on a different server.
              4. The React App will then talk to that Backend server/ Backend API, which is a server that exposes different URLs that requests can be sent to.




              
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ Fetching Data from an API


  - An API can also be called a Backend app. 
       An API backend is a way for developers to link their software and application to cloud-based storage (Database), making it easier to link up with software development kits and APIs.

  - API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 
            Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you‚Äôre using an API.
            
  - When talking about API in the context of HTTP requests, we are often referring to 'REST API' or 'GraphQL Api'.            ' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeAOEAmR0D0 '
          Which are two different standards for a server should expose its data.





// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ Sending a GET Request

 - We can use 'AXIOS' npm package which makes it easy to make Http Requests      ' https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios ' 

 - We can also use the 'fetch API' which is built-in to browsers. It allows us to FETCH and SEND data.
        Can be used to send Http requests and work with responses.

/ Using 'useEffect()' hook for Http Requests
                             
                             
      - using 'useEffect()' hook to fetch data from an API (side-effect) as soon as the page loads for the very first time, AND when any of its dependencies change. 
      
      - In the exmaple below, since we are passing a function inside the 'useEffect()' hook, we also need to add that function as a dependency in the 'useEffect()' hook dependencies array. 
              But remember, since functions are objects behind the scenes, with every re-render of the component function, there will be a new version of that function that we passed as a dependency (due to how 'Reference types' are stored in memory) which will result in the data being fetched everytime the component function is re-rendered [infinite-loop].
                 üü¢ To avoid that we can use 'useCallback()' hook on the dependency funciton.

 / Building Custom React Hooks
                                 

  - What are "Custom Hooks" ?
      „Ä∞ "Custom Hooks" are in the end just regular functions, same as built-in React hooks. But "Custom Hooks" can contain stateful logic that can be re-used accross the app (such as setting up a subscription and                    remembering the current value), all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.

      „Ä∞ The main reason to write a"Custom Hooks" is for code reusability. For example, instead of writing the same code across multiple components that use the same common stateful logic (say a ‚ÄúsetState‚Äù or localStorage            logic), you can put that code inside a custom hook and reuse it.
      
      „Ä∞ ‚≠ê Unlike regular functions, 'Custom Hooks' can use built-in React hooks and React State.
      
      
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ Creating a 'Custom React Hook' function
                                 

  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> "Custom Hooks" function names nust start with 'use'. (ie: ' const useCounter = () => { ... }; ')
                 It will be regular function in the end, but the 'use' keyword tells React that it will be a custom Hook.       
                 
  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê We just want to add stateful logic code inside of our "Custom Hooks", and NOT return JSX code. As shown in example below
  
  - All built-in React hooks inside "Custom Hooks" will be TIED/Isolated to the component inwhich we use the "Custom Hook" in. 
                  Just as if we copied the code inside the "Custom Hook" into the component we want to use it in.
                  
  - We can return things in "Custom Hooks". For instance a 'state'.
  
  - Since "Custom Hooks" are just function in the end, they can also accept paramters.
  
  
  
  // --- EXAMPLE ---  
            // ---- Custom Hook ----
            import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

            const useCounter = (direction = "forwards") => {
              const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

              let increment = direction === "forwards" ? 1 : -1;

              useEffect(() => {
                const interval = setInterval(() => {
                  setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + increment);
                }, 1000);

                return () => clearInterval(interval);
              }, [increment]);

              return counter;
            };

  / `  REDUX (An Alternative to Context API)  `

    - REDUX is a very popular third-party React library, that used to manage app-wide state.
    
// -------------
„Ä∞ ' What is REDUX? And why do we use it? '
                                 
    - REDUX is a state management system for 'cross-component state' or 'app-wide state'. 
          Helps us manage state across multiple component or even across the complete App
          
    - Redux is a Flux-like state management library. ?? 


// -------------
„Ä∞ ' What is Local State, Cross-Component state, and App-wide state? '
               
    - 'Local state' -> is a state that belongs to a single component and is managed inside that component using 'useState' or 'useReducer'. ie: a controlled input field 
    
    - 'Cross-Component state' -> a state that affects multplie components. ie: an open/close state of a modal window where the trigger to open it, is not inside the modal component function itself.
                                        Can be implemented with 'useState' or 'useReducer' but it would require 'prop chains'/'prop drilling'.        üõë Not bad just more complex that Local state üõë
      
    - 'App-wide state' -> a state that does not just affect multiple components, but most/ALL components in an application, 
                                ie: User authentication status, where a user loggs in to their account which changes everything on the page to show their account data. 
                              Can also be managed with 'useState' or 'useReducer' which would require 'prop chains'/'prop drilling'.        üõë CAN BE VERY CUMBERSOME üõë 
                              
                              
  
          ‚≠ê 'Cross-Component state' & 'App-wide state' can be very cumbersome when managed with 'useState' or 'useReducer' ('prop chains'/'prop drilling'), so to avoid this we can sue the:
                                 1. The React built-in 'Context API' which makes managing 'Cross-Component state' or 'App-wide state', easier. Just like we did in the Food-order-App.
                                 2. 'REDUX' is an alternative to 'Context API' which also lets us manage 'Cross-Component state' or 'App-wide state' alot easier.
                                 
                                
                                        üåü  So 'Context API' & 'REDUX' helps us manage 'Cross-Component state' or 'App-wide state' alot easier by avoiding 'prop chains' / 'prop drilling'  üåü
                                                


// -------------
 „Ä∞ ' Why do we need 'REDUX' library if we already have the React built-in 'Context-API'? '

                                        React 'Context API' is good for changing a theme or maybe even authentication, but its NOT great if our data changes alot.

     -- 'REDUX' is all about having ONE 'Central Data (state) Store' in our application.
               ‚≠ê‚≠ê Always just ONE store for our entire application. No more than ONE store in an application. ‚≠ê‚≠ê          <--  IMPORTANT
                
      So in this 'Central Data (state) Store' we would store Authentication state, Theme state, UserInput state, etc.....
                Whichever 'Cross-Component states' or 'App-wide states' we have, can all be stored in the 'Central Data (state) Store'.
                
      
     -- We have data (state) inside our App 'Central Data (state) Store', which we access from different components in our App. For instance, if an authentication state changes we want to know about it from our components so that we can react acccordingly and update the UI.
      
     
        üí® `  GETING data (state) from the 'Central Data (state) Store' through component SUBSCRIPTIONS ` üëáüëá
        
            Inorder for our components to access data (state) inside the 'Central Data (state) Store', components setup 'Subscriptions' to the 'Central Data (state) Store'.
              So components 'subscribe' to the 'Central Data (state) Store', and whenever a certain data (state) that a component needs in the store, changes, the store notifies the component of that state change, so that the component can update the UI accordingly.
              
              
              
        üí® `  CHANGING/UPDATING data (state) INSIDE the 'Central Data (state) Store' ` üëáüëá     
        
            ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> Components *'NEVER'* directly manipulate data (state) in the store. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
                  
            Instead, inorder to manipulate data in the store, we can use a concept called 'Reducers'. Where we setup a 'Reducer function'.
                üåü This 'Reducer function', is then responsible for 'mutating/changing the Store data'. 
                
                üìù 'Reducer function' is üõë NOT the 'useReducer' hook üõë.  It is a GENERAL programming concept which takes some input, transforms that input/reduce it, and then spit out a new output/result. 
                    The 'Reducer function' is a PURE function. EXPLAINED below üëáüëá
                
                   -------- `What is a 'Reducer function'?` ---------   
               „Ä∞ A 'Reducer function' is a standard JavaScript funciton which will be called by the 'Redux' library. 
                            - The 'Reducer function' ALWAYS receive two paramters:  1. The old or existing state.
                                                                                    2. And the dispatched 'action' that will change that state.
                            - The 'Reducer function' MUST then return a 'new State Object'. 
                                    Therefore a 'Reducer function' should be a pure function, which means that:
                                                                                    1. The same inputs must lead to same outputs, ie: entered state parameter and returned state object should have same structure.
                                                                                    2. And that there should be no side-effects inside of that function. 
                                                                                              So we must not send an 'HTTP request', save something in 'Local Storage', fetch something from 'Local Storage', etc...
                                      Instead a 'Reducer' should just be a function that takes given inputs provided by Redux, and then produces the expected output, which is a new state object.
                                      
                                        
                                                                                                                                                       
             
                              
        üí® `  CONNECTING components and 'Reducer functions' to manipulate/change data (state) inside the 'Central Data (state) Store'  ` üëáüëá   
        
              - Ultimately, components will be the one to 'TRIGGER' data change in the store, through 'Reducer functions'.
                        Like a click on a button that triggers data change in the store.
                        
              - Inorder for comoponents to 'TRIGGER' data change in the store, they dispatch/trigger 'ACTIONS'.
                  An 'Action' is a simple JavaScript Object which desribes the KIND of operation that the 'Reducer function' should perform.
             
              After an action is dispatched/triggered by a component   ->   Redux forwards that 'Action' to the 'Reducer function'   ->   Then the 'Reducer function' executes the oparation described in the 'Action' which the manipulates data (state) inside the 'store'.
      
      ‚≠ê In short -->  Components dispatches 'Actions' which describe what should be done   ->   then these 'Actions' are forwarded to the 'Reducer function'   ->   'Reducer function' then performs the 'Action' and spits out a new 'state' which will replace an exisiting 'state' in the 'Central Data (state) Store'.
      
      When that state in the 'Central Data (state) Store' is updated, subscribed components get notified so that they can update their UI.
      
      
  // ----------------------------------------------------------------
      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  SUMMARY  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
      How Redux works SUMMARY --> 1. Every app has a single 'Store' which stores states
                                  2. Different components in the app can 'SUBSCRIBE' to the store to access these states, and get notified whenever a state changes
                                  3. Components cannot directly change data/states inside the 'store', but can indirectly change data/states in the store through 'Reducer functions'.
                                  4. Components can dispatch 'Actions', which is an object that describes an operation, these 'actions' are then executed by the 'Reducer functions' which changes a state inside the store.
                                  5. Subscribed components then get notified of that change inorder for them to update the UI accordingly.

      3. run 'npm init -y' in terminal
      4. run 'npm i redux' 
      5. import redux package in the .js file.      NOTE: Since we will execute the JavaScript with Node.js, We need to use the default Node.js import syntax for importing a third-party package. Like so üëá

      6. Then in the .js file, we will need to create a 'store', a 'reducer function' to change the store, an 'action', and a component or a function.
      7. To run the code and show output in the Terminal run 'node {name of javascript file}'

        / --- 1. Create the store
        // - 'createStore()' is method exposed by redux library, which creates a store.
        // - The store should manage some data, that data is determined by the 'Reducer function'. Because it is the reducer function that will produce new state snapshots, whenever an 'action' is dispatched.
        // - When we run the code for the first time, the 'Reducer function' will be executed with a default 'action' that should spit out the initial state.
        // - We PASS in the 'Reducer function' as a parameter inside the 'createStore()' function. Because the store needs to know which 'Reducer function' is responsible for changing that store. Because its the 'Reducer'            that works together with the store.

        // ‚≠ê When 'store' is initialized, 'Redux' will EXECUTE the passed in 'Reducer function' inside 'createStore()' method, for the first time. So if we dont specify a default or initialValue to our state, it will be               'undefined' which will result in an ERROR.
        // ‚≠ê So We need to define a default value to the 'state' parameter, so that it is not 'undefined' when the 'store' is initialized. The defaultValue will ONLY be used when the state would otherwise be                       'undefined'.

      üìù 'Redux' is NOT react specific. It can be used any JavaScript project. It doesnt know anything about React and doesnt care about React.
      
         - To make working with 'Redux' in React applications easier, there is another package which we should install called the 'react-redux' package.
                                                                                                                              
         - 'react-redux' package makes connecting to React applications to 'Redux' stores, reducers, etc..., very simple. For example it will make it very simple to subscribe components to the 'Redux' store.

          - We can use 'useStore()' hook which gives us direct access to the store. [ üõë DONT USE üõë]
          - For class-based components we can wrap our component with 'connect' function   [ üõë NOT IMPORTANT üõë]
                                 
          - 'useSelector()' hook is a React hook that allows us to extract data from the Redux store state. It is more convenient to use that 'useStore()' because it allows us to select a CERTAIN state that is managed by              the store, rather than ALL the states managed in the store.
          
                üåü 'useSelector()' hook takes in a function as an argument, which determines which state/data we want to extract from the store. üåü This function will automatically be executed for us by 'react-redux' üåü
                
                              ie: '  const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter)  '
                                 
          - ‚≠ê‚≠ê  When we use 'useSelector()', 'react-redux' will automatically SUBSCRIBE the component inwhich we are using 'useSelector()' in, to the Redux store.  ‚≠ê‚≠ê
                         That subscribed component will then be NOTIFIED and RE-EXECUTED whenever the extracted state ('counter') changes in the Redux store. 
                         
                         If the component ever gets unmounted/removed from the DOM, then React-redux will clear/remove that component subscription to the Redux store. 
                                              So React-Redux manages the component subscription for us behind the scenes.

     „Ä∞ Payload is a non-official, community accepted naming convention for the property that holds the actual data in a Redux action object.     
      
      - Remember, 'Actions' are plain JavaScript objects that must have a 'type' attribute to indicate the type of action performed.
      - 'Actions' are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. 
      -  It carries a payload of information from your application to store. 
      
      'Action payloads' are just extra properties that holds data, which we add to our action object, when dispatching actions to the Redux store reducer function.
      

      With action payloads we can dispatch dynamic action values to the store to manipulate the state synamically, based on user input for instance.

/ ` How to NOT update the state in Reducer functions `
                           
                           
   - IMPORTANT --> returned state in the Reducer function does NOT merge with the existing state, it 'REPLACES' / 'OVERIDES' the exising state. 
   
          So we must ALWAYS return the same structure of the state snapshot, when we update it in the reducer function, because we override the old state.
          
                               
 
          
     -- IMPORTANT -- üõë We should NEVER mutate the existing state by directly mutating the original state property (As shown below), when working with REDUX. üõë
                           
                  „Ä∞ It is very bad practice to do so because Object and Arrays are 'Reference types' in JavaScript which are stored in the Heap. Which means that when we direcly mutate a state property, what we are doing is that we are allocating a new piece of memory in the Call Stack for that state object, which has a value that points to the original Object stored in the HEAP. So we are creating a new variable in the Call Stack everytime we directly mutate a state property, which all point to the SAME object that is stored in the HEAP and by doing so we keep mutating the ORIGINAL object in the heap. 
                  
                  This is bad practice and could lead to bugs, unpredictable behavior, and can make debugging our App difficult.
                  
                 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   INSTEAD we must ALWAYS OVERRIDE the exisintg state object by returning a new state object, that contains the same structure of the original object (contains all the same properties with brand new values).  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê So we should mutate the state in an immutable manner.
                 
                 // ----- Instructor words
                 Mutating state directly can lead to odd bugs, and components that are hard to optimize.

                 - So it is recommended to mutate the state in an immutable manner. 
                 - So using the spread operator, we spread our previous state that we get and to it we add our new change which later gets merged to our new state. 
                 - This is what is meant by doing the update in an immutable manner. 
                 - So the general approach is to make a copy of our state, mutate that copy in an immutable manner and merge it to the original state. üåüüåüüåü

/ ` What is Redux Toolkit and Why use it `
                           
                               
      The more complex our App becomes, the more complex it becomes to use REDUX correclty. 
        Which is why we can use 'Redux Toolkit' package to make using REDUX in complex application to make it easier to setup and maintain an App-wide state using REDUX.
      
      - Some potential problems we could face while using REDUX as our application continues to grow are (as we manage more and more states in Redux): üëá
      
            1. One issue could be with 'Action type property values' which are defined as strings. As our app gets bigger it will be hard to manage these action types because 
                    - They could cause bugs through typos
                    - We could have clashing action type values 
                               
                           const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
                            if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {              üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà
                              return {                                    
                                counter: state.counter + 1,                        
                                showCounter: state.showCounter,                        
                              };
                            }

                            return state;
                          };    
                           
                           
                     -- Possible soultion:   We could create constants for each action type value and use that constant everywhere in our app, inorder to avoid typos.
                              ie:    export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
                           
                           üëÜüëÜüëÜ This approach was used in the past with REDUX before 'React toolkits' were introduced.
                           
                    -------------
          2. Another issue we could face with big applications and REDUX is the 'amount of data we have in our store'. 
                As our app gets bigger, we will need to add more states and copy them each time we return a new state through an action, inorder to always have the same                       structure of the initial state with same state properties.         Which can result in a HUGE store file that is hard to manage.
                
      [Which was one disadvantage of 'React Context API', which is that by having all the app contexts in one Contect Provider file, then the file would be too big and hard to maintain]
                           
                           
                    -------------
         3. 'State Immutablity' could also be another problem with large apps using REDUX (dicussed in above section). We have to ensure that we always return a brand new state snapshot, which has the same structure as the initail state. And not directly manipulate the existing state anywhere.
           üõë We could easily direclty manipulate exisiting state properties *without even knowing* if we have NESTED state Objects or Arrays INSIDE other state properties. 
                    ie:   
                    
                          const reducerFn = (state = initialState, action) => {
                            return  {
                                      employeeName: state.name,
                                      employeeId: state.id,
                                      address: {
                                          locality: {                                       üëàüëàüëàüëàüëà NESTED OBJECT
                                              address1: state.addressFirst,
                                              address2: state.addressSecond,
                                          }
                                    }
                                  }
                                });

              With Redux itself too, you could split your Redux setup into different files, so there also it didn't ended up being in one large file.

              Redux Toolkit allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process and automatically apply the best recommended practices.

              Redux Toolkit was introduced to address the following issues that we had in case of Redux.

              1. Configuring a Redux Store is too complex or cumbersome.

              2. It requires a lot of extra packages to build a large scalable application.

              and lastly

              Redux requires too much boilerplate code which makes it cumbersome to write efficient and clean code.

    - Run --> '  npm install @reduxjs/toolkit  '
                           
                           
    - üåü If we already have 'REDUX' package installed in our App. We could uninstall after installing 'Redux toolkit' because it is already included in the 'REDUX toolkit' package.
          run --> ' npm uninstall Redux '

/ ` USING Redux Toolkit `
                           
  
          - We use 'Redux Toolkit' in our Redux 'store.js' file. It simplifies certain aspects when working with Redux.

 / `   'createSlice()' function   --  from 'Redux Toolkit'   `   
                           
    - import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
                          
    - 'createSlice()' function lets us prepare a slice of our global state. So when we have pieces of state that are not directly related, like an authentication state and a counter state, we could create different slices (potentially in different files) to make our code more maintainable.
    
    
    -Note:  We can also use a Redux Toolkit function called 'createReducer()', but 'createSlice()' function is more powerfull than 'createReducer()'. 
        It will simplify a couple of aspects in one go.
        
      
   // ---  USING  'createSlice()' function
    - 'createSlice()' function wants an object as an argument, which represents a piece of slice from our Global state. This Object needs three properties: 
                           
              1. A 'name' property. Which is an identifier for that piece of state slice. Its value is ussually a string describing the state we are using the 'createSlice()' function for (can be anything we want).
              2. Next the 'createSlice()' Object needs an 'initialState' property, where its value is the initialState of our state slice. 
              3. And then a 'reducers' property. Which its value is an Object, which we could say that represents a MAP of all the REDUCERS this state slice needs. In that 'reducers' object we can add methods with any name of our choice (method names are importent which will be discussed later), which will do the same thing as when dispatching actions üëá in the Reducer function when using normal Redux store (without Redux Toolkits).
                          
                                              // --- STANDARD Redux Reducer function WITHOUT Redux Toolkits 'createSlice()' function
                                                const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
                                                  
                                                  if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {                  üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà

                                                      counter: state.counter + 1,                     üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà

                                                  return state;
                                                };
                           
                           
            - ‚≠ê‚≠ê  These methods in the 'reducers' Object, which is inside the 'createSlice()' function object argument:
                          „Ä∞ will be called for us by REDUX depending on which 'action' was triggered
                          „Ä∞ will AUTOMATICALLY receive the latest/current 'state' as well as the 'action', as ARGUMENTS.  
                          „Ä∞ We ussually DONT need the 'action' argument tho, since these methods will be called for us by Redux Toolkits depending on which 'action' was triggered.
                          As a result üëÜ, we dont need to write our own 'if' statement check anymore (ie: '  if (action.type === "INCREMENT") { return {....} }; '), instead we will able to use these different 'reducers' methods and dispatch 'actions' that target these different 'reducers' methods.
                          
                          We will need 'action' argument tho, whenever we need to dispatch 'Action payloads' which are just extra properties that holds data (check explanation on 'ACTION PAYLOADS' at top). Discussed below üëá
                           
                                
                                
                          „Ä∞ Inside the 'reducers' methods we **ARE** allowed to directly 'MUTATE' the state properties  (ie: 'state.counter++'). 
                          
                              Unlike with normal Redux (WITHOUT Redux Toolkits), where directly mutating the state was bad practice and FORBIDDEN because doing so would cause bugs due to state being an Object this a reference type and so we would be mutating the original state object stored in the Heap everytimg we directly mutate a state property. 
                              
            üåüüåüüåü It is not FORBIDDIEN with 'Redux Toolkits' to directly 'MUTATE' the state properties, because 'Redux Toolkits' uses another package called 'Immer' which will detect code like this ' state.counter++ ' which makes it SEEM like we are directly manipulating state properties, but then 'Immer' package will
                              1. automaticlly CLONE the existing state object   --> 
                              2. CREATE a new state Object with the edited state properties, all while COPYING over all the other state object properties that we did NOT change / were not edited  -->  
                              3. and then it will return that new state object which OVERRIDES the previous state Object that we are editing, in an IMMUTABLE way.
                              
                 üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ So 'Immer' package that 'REDUX Toolkits' uses does the same thing that we would do when returning a new state Object in normal Redux Reducer function *WITHOUT* Redux Toolkits,  by overriding the previous state Object with the new returned one.  üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ
                           
                           
                            „Ä∞ When using Redux Toolkits, wee can still have reducers that listen to actions that have extra 'Payloads' / extra data. We can do so by using the 'action' argument available in the 'reducers' object methods as a second argument. 
                            
                                 
                            
                  // ---- EXAMPLE of 'createSlice()' funciton (in the 'store.js' file)

 / `   'configureStore()' function   --  from 'Redux Toolkit'   `  
                           
                           
      - To use the state slice that we created using 'createSlice()' function, we can use the 'configureStore()' function provided by the 'Redux Toolkit' package INSTEAD of 'createStore()' function (which is provided by the standard 'Redux' package without 'Redux Toolkit')
                           
      - 'configureStore()' function is similar to 'createStore()' function, but it lets us merge multiple Reducer Functions together into ONE.
      
      „Ä∞ Because REMEMBER  ->  - ***** We can only have ONE STORE in Redux with ONE Reducer Function that manipulates its state ***** 
                               - In standard Redux, we pass that Reducer function to the 'createStore()' function.   ie:    ' const counterStore = createStore(counterReducer); '
        (NOTE: we can combine multiple reducer functions into ONE and then use that ONE reducer function inside the 'createStore()' function, using 'combineReducers' function available in standard Redux WITHOUT Redux Toolkit)
                           
      üåüüåü But with 'Redux Toolkit' we can use the 'configureStore()' funciton instead of 'createStore()' function available in standard Redux, which lets us create a store for our App with the difference that it makes merging multiple Reducer functions into ONE Reducer function, EASIER.
      
       - 'configureStore()' funciton lets us pass multiple reducer Functions into it as an argument, and then behind the scenes, 'Redux Toolkit' combines all these Reducer functions into one Reducer function which is used to create the store and make it available to use in the App.
                 `üåü Because REMEMBER, we can only have ONE store in REDUX, with ONE Reducer funtion that manipulates the store state in that store. üåü`
      
      
      
      - To make the slice we created available to components in the App, we first need to store the RETURNED value of calling 'createSlice()' function in a variable/constant.
      
              ie:  const counterSlice = createSlice({
                      name: 'counter',
                      initialState,
                      reducers: {
                        .....
                      }
                    });
                           
      - ‚≠ê We can then use the 'reducer' method (NOT 'reducers'), available on the 'createSlice()' function returned value (ie: ' counterSlice.reducer ')) inorder to get access to the reducer methods that we set up in the slice. (ie: the reducer methods we created in the 'reducers' object property, in 'createSlice()' function)
      
                                                                    üëáüëá
            Behind the scenes, The 'reducer' method ' counterSlice.reducer ', is basically a big 'REDUCER FUNCTION' with 'if' statements that trigger the different reducer methods that we created in the 'createSlice()'    function, depending on the ACTION type. 
            So just like we would do with standard Redux WITHOUT Redux Toolkit, where we use 'if' statements in the store Reducer function, to check for the action type that was dispatched then return a new state object.
                           
                            
           
    
      ---------
      / ---- using 'configureStore()' funciton
              
      - 'configureStore()' funciton takes in a 'configuration' Object as an argument, Where we pass in a 'reducer' property, which is an EXPECTED property by 'configureStore()' funciton. 
      
      üìù SIDE NOTE: the property is called 'reducer' and NOT 'reducers', because remember in the end Redux expects ONE Reducer function that is responsible for manipulating the global state object.
      
      - The value for the 'reducer' property can be a SINGLE Reducer function, or it can be an Object that contains MULTIPLE Reducer functions (as 'key/value' pairs) which will then be merged together as one big Reducer function by the 'configureStore()' funciton.
      
      - In that 'reducer' property object containing multiple Reducer functions, we can give each Reducer function a 'key' / property name of our choice and a value of the reducer function we want to attach it to.
      
      
            // -- example with a SINGLE reducer function in 'configureStore()' function

                    const store = configureStore({
                      reducer: counterSlice.reducer,
                    });


            // -- example with a MULTIPLE reducer functionS in 'configureStore()' function   [üü¢ USE THIS even if we have a SINGLE reducer function üü¢]
                  
                        const store = configureStore({
                          reducer: {
                            counter: counterSlice.reducer,            // <-- Our Reducer function
                            anotherReducer: anotherReducerSlice.reducer,
                          },
                        });
                          
                           
        ---------------------------------         
        /* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  IMPORTANT:  - Even when we work with multiple state slices, we still only have ONE Reduxstore.

                                          - And that store only has ONE root 'reducer' property, where we can register our state slices.
                                          - These state slices in the 'reducer' property are then merged together by Redux to form ONE main Reducder function that can be used in the store.   */

 / `   Disptching actions in 'Redux Toolkit'   ` 
                           
                           
      - For Dispatching actions, 'createSlice()' function has us covered. It automatically creates unique 'ACTION' identifiers/ types for our different Reducer methods (that are inside the 'reducers' property in our state slice),
        just like we would do when using STANDARD Redux when dispatching actions.
                
                       'üëáüëáüëá STANDARD Redux WITHOUT Toolkit üëáüëáüëá'            
                  ie: `     const increaseBy = () => {
                              dispatch({ type: "INCREASE_BY", amount: 10 });      
                            };            üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ
                      `               // Action Identifier
                
                
      - To get hold of these automatically created action identifiers and be able to use them to dispatch actions, we can use the 'actions' method available on the returned value from the 'createSlice()' function.
            ie: ' console.log(counterSlice.actions) '
                           
            „Ä∞ This 'actions' method will contain an object where the 'KEY' names of its properties match the reducer method names that we created in the 'createSlice()' function, inside its 'reducers' property. 
               And the value of those properies are NOT the reducer methods we defined in our state slice, INSTEAD they are methods that are created automaticlly by Redux Toolkit, 
             üåüüåü which when CALLED  ->  
                      1. will create action objects for us just like the ones we created on our own with STANDARD Redux when dispatching actions (shown below)
                      2. which we can then use to dispatch those action objects inorder to trigger the different Reducer methods it generated from our original reducer methods, in the state slice

                Which is why these methods that are called on the 'actions' method (ie: ' counterSlice.actions.increment(); ') are called  'Action Creators' because they create action Objects for our reducer methods in                   the state slice.
                       
                       'STANDARD Redux WITHOUT Toolkit'   -->     const increaseBy = () => {           üëáüëá  -->  // Action Payload. which is simply data that will be used by the reducer method to upde the state.
                                                                    dispatch({ type: "INCREASE_BY", amount: 10 });
                                                                  };         üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ

                These automatically created action objects will contain ->  
                                              1. A 'type' property with a UNIQUE identifier value, per action. So we dont have to worry about typos or coming up with identifier values
                                                      ie:  'dispatch({ type: UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER });'
                                              2. And if the reducer method needs an 'action payload' --> then we can pass that action in a an object as an argument to the 'Action Creator' method we call when dispatching                                                   an action. That 'action payload' will be available in a 'payload' property in the generated and dispatched 'Action object', so to extract and be able to use that 'action                                                    payload' in our reducer method, we will need to access it through the 'payloads' property.
                                                      ie:  'dispatch({ type: UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, payload: { amount: 10, } });'

        ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  VERY IMPORTANT  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê              -----   ALL 'REDUCER FUNCTIONS' concept. Not for Redux  -----

  [[  NOT just for the REDUX 'Reducer function', but all 'Reducer functions' in general (ie: the reducer function we use in 'useReducer' as well, etc....)  ]]

   - REMEMBER --> Our 'Reducer function' should be a: 
                                      1. 'pure' function
                                      2. 'side-effect' free function
                                      3. 'synchronous' function
                           
  - So the 'Reducer function' should take in some input (which contains the 'previous state' and the 'dispatched action', as arguments)     
 /                      -->     and then produce some OUTPUT  (which is a new state with the saem structure as the initialState)  without any side-effects along the way or any ashyncronous code that blocks it
 
                         üõë‚úãüõë‚úã SO no 'side-effects' or any 'ashyncronous' should be part of our Reducer functions üõë‚úãüõë‚úã

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/ '  Where should side-effects and async tasks be executed when working with Redux ??????  '     
                           
    -- So when working with Redux. If we need to dispatch an action that would involve a side-effect (like an http-request that should be sent), Where should we put that 'side-effect' or 'Ashyncronous' code ????? 
     
  // answer üëáüëáüëá
      We have two posible places where we CAN put our side-effects in that case: 
                                                            1. We can directly put the 'async' code sirectly into the component,  (ie: in a 'useEffect()' hook, for example).
                                                                    And then only dispatch an action once the 'side-effect' is done.  (ie: data is fetched via http-request)
                                                                        (So Redux doesnt know anything about that 'side-effect')
                                                              
                                                            2. OR we can we write our own 'action creator' functons. So we dont use the automatically generated ones that 'Redux Toolkit' provides. Instead we write our own                                                                'action creators'.       
                                                                And for those 'action creators' that we create, 'Redux' has a solution that allows us to perform 'side-effects' and run 'asychronous tasks' as part of these                                                                    'action creators' that we create. WITHOUT changing the 'Reducer funciton', because 'Reducer functions' MUST remain 'side-effect' free.
                                                                
                     [REMEMBER (explained above), 'action creators' are just objects with 'type' property and possibly a 'payload' property, that is used tell the 'Reducer function' 
                      what type of action was dispatched so that the state can be updated accordingly. 'action creators' are automaticlly generated by us in Redux. Or we could create 
                        our own as just mentioned]

    1. We should add 'Synchronous', 'side-effect' free code (ie: tranforming data for instance) in Redux 'Reducer methods' üëáüëá
    
      Redux Team specifically recommend putting as much logic as possible in reducers:

      Wherever possible, try to put as much of the logic for calculating a new state into the appropriate reducer, rather than in the code that prepares and dispatches the action (like a click handler). 
      This helps ensure that more of the actual app logic is easily testable, enables more effective use of time-travel debugging, and helps avoid common mistakes that can lead to mutations and bugs.
      
      
    2. And add 'Asynchrounous' code (ie: http-requests) in the components themselves.
    
    
    
    
 /// ----------------------------
   üåüüåüüåü  IMPORTANT -> REMEMBER never directly manipulate Redux store state properties from components, like we do with 'React Toolkit' (ie: state.counter++) because remember we dont actually directly manipulate the state properties with 'React Toolkit', instead 'immer' package overrides the previous Redux store state with a new state object, everytimme an action is dispatched.
                            
    IT is very BAD practice to directly manipulate Redux store properties from outside the Redux store because the Redux store state is an object which is a 'reference type' and so if we directly change one of its properties in a component, we would be changing the original Redux store object stored in memory.
    
    Instead IF we want to update the Redux store state from outside the Redux store [[[ ' WHICH WE USSUALLY DONT NEED TO ' ]]], from a component, we would need to create a copy of that Redux store object, then manipulate data inside it, and then override that existing Redux store state with the newly generated state object from outside the Redux store.

  ` FrontEnd code vs BackEnd code `
                                  
                                   see image called  -->  "FrontEnd code vs BackEnd code" in 'REDUX' folder
                                   
                                   
  - The code we need to write on the Front-End and where we write that code will depend on the BackEnd code. 
      So for intance, if we are using a BackEnd as a Dummy backend that just stores data and doesnt have any logic, we would have to create all the logic in the FrontEnd. 
        So we would Send the data to the database and then when fetching that data from the BackEnd we would add logic in the FrontEnd to transform that fetched data before displaying it on the screen.
      
          ie: when adding an item to a cart in an App. We would need to: 
                                    1. Send the item to the database when user adds the item to cart. 
                                    2. Then fetch that data as the app mounts, from the database. 
                                    3. Then transform that data using logic we add in the FrontEnd. To show the cartItems in a certain way, then display them in the App.
                                    
                                    
    - OR we could add all the logic we need in the BackEnd using 'Node.js' to transform the data we send to the backend. In that case we would not need to add logic in the frontend that would transform that data.

/ ` Connecting Redux with side-effects and Asynchronous code `
      
      
      - REMEMBER  ->  'Reducer functions' MUST be 'PURE', 'side-effect' free and 'synchronous' functions.
      
      - So when we have any code that produces a side-effect or is Asynchrounous, like sending an http request or 'setTimeout()'  -> ‚≠ê Such code MUST NOT go into our 'Reducer function' or 'reducer methods' if we are using Redux Toolkit ‚≠ê 
      
            üõëüõë‚õî‚õî‚õî‚úã   SO NEVER create a side-effect  /  send http-request inside our 'Reducer function'   üõëüõë‚õî‚õî‚õî‚úã  
            
            
            
   -- ` üü¢ Where should we add side-effects and async tasks when working with Redux?? `
            
            We have two options:  1. We can simply ignore Redux and execute side-effects and async tasks in components (in 'useEffect()' hook)               <-- [üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢ PREFER THIS üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢]
                                  2. Or we can create an 'action creator' which would allow us to run ashyncronous code, or generally any side-effect code
                                      üëÜ second approach helps keep our components lean by having asynchronous code logic in our store slices files.
                                                  [second approaach is explained more below with an example üëáüëá]
      
         
                                  '   check 'react-redux advanced project' to see how to implement both options   '
                          
// ----------------------------------------                      
/ ` Second approach of creating 'action creator' to run ashyncronous code, or generally any side-effect code, when using Redux `   [OPTION 2 üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ]
                          
                          
  - Remember in Redux Toolkit, 'action creators' are used to generate action Objects which are used when dispatching actions to the Redux store Reducer funciton. 
              ['see `  Disptching actions in 'Redux Toolkit'  ` section above üëÜ for more explanation about the Redux Toolkit 'action creators'. ']         
                          
                          
    - We can write our own 'action creators' and we can write them to create 'Thunks'.
    
    - ` What is a 'Thunk' ????  ` 
    A 'Thunk' is simply a function that delays an action until later. Until something else is finished.
    
    So we could write an 'action creator' as a 'Thunk', so that it does not immediatly return the 'action object' but instead returns ANOTHER function which eventually returns the 'action Object' after some time. 
        So that we can run some other code before dispatching the 'action object', to the Redux store Reducer function.
        
        
        
    -- Creating our own 'action creator'
                          
        - Remember Reducer functions should always be 'pure', 'side-effect' free and 'synhronous' functions. So they CANT have any http requests inside them or 'setTomoeout()', for instance.
        
        - ‚≠ê So when creating our own 'action creators' to handle side-effects, we can add them inside our Redux Toolkit slice file, but OUTSIDE of the reducer methods in the 'createSlice()' function. So underneath the                 'createSlice()' function.
        
        - When creating our own 'action creator' as a 'Thunk', we can return another function which receives the 'dispatch' function as an argument.
             That returned function will automatically get executed by Redux Toolkit when we dispatch the 'action creator' function  we created, from components.
        
        - Remember that Redux Toolkit provides 'action creators' for us, for each reducer method we create inside the 'createSlice()' function (inside the 'reducers' property in its object argument).
        
        - We call the created 'action creator' function from other components by dispatching it just like dispatching any other 'action creator' method provided to us by the Reducer methods we create inside 'createSlice()'. 
        
        - When the 'action creator' function is dispatched, its returned function will automatically get called/executed by Redux Toolkit.
            Even tho we are not dispatching an action object   [ie: STANDARD Redux --> ` dispatch({ type: "INCREASE_BY", amount: 10 });  `  ] , instead we are dispatching our own created action creator function ->
              Redux Toolkit is prepared for that because it does not only accept 'action object' with 'type' property, but it also accepts 'action creators' that return functions and so Redux Toolkit will automatically               execute that returned function for us. Redux Toolkit will also provide the 'dispatch' function as an argument in that returned function, so that we can dispatch actions inside that returned function. 
              
              Since this is a common pattern where we want 'action creators' that can perform side-effects and that can then dispatch other actions which eventually reach the Redux Toolkit store Reducer methods.

 / `  React Router  `


 - Multiple pages in a single app. The illusion of having multiple pages with different URLs, to the same Single-Page applications. 
          So we are still building a Single-page application where React and the Browser is responsible for updating what the user sees, but we'll  be able to change the URL and use multiple pages.
                               
    
// -------------
  „Ä∞ ' What is Routing? '
                               
   -  Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. 
        To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page.
        
   -  Routing means that different paths in the URL, loads different pages.
    
    
// -------------
  „Ä∞ ' Why use React Routing for website pages navigation? '

  
    - In reality we want websites that have different 'paths'. These different 'paths' in the URL, load different pages, so that when the URL changes, we change the visible content of the page 
                        (We load different pages for different 'paths'). 
                                                                                  üëáüëá              
    - üìù Side Note: 'paths' are after the website domain, ie: ' www.codepen.io/bigmikel9 ')
    
    - The combination of those different pages (inwhich each have their own 'path'), makes up a website.  
      
    
      ------ ` Difference between traditional multi-page websites and a React Single-Page application ` ------
                               
          - In a traditional multi-page website (without React) we would have some server that sends back different HTML files for different URLs. 
          
          - We would build a traditional multi-page website by creating different HTML files for each page, and storing them on a server. 
              Then to open these different pages on the website, the client would send a request to the server which then sends back the HTML page to the client, which is rendered by the browser.   
          
          When we have different HTML pages, that means that we dont have a 'Single-Page app', which means that when we change the URL üëá
                                            1. We leave the browser (We leave our running client-side app)   
                                            2. Fetch a new page  (client sends a request to the server)
                                            3. Wait for the request-response cycle  
                                            4. and then let the browser render the new HTML page 
                                            
          
                  üëÜ Which is one of the reasons why we switched to React, because we dont want this traditional flow üëÜ
                              Instead we want a: 
                                      - A client-side application (a JavaScript web app) which runs in the browser
                                      - And we want to utilize this application to change whats visible on the screen WITH JavaScript --> 
                                         ü§© so that we can provide this instant reactive user experience, which we can do with JavaScript through React in the browser.
                                         
        - So we use React to build 'Single-Page applications' which: 
                                            1. Has ONE HTML page which is initially loaded when the user first visits our website, thereafter JavaScript takes over
                                                  (Only ONE initial HTML request & response)
                                            2. We can then manipulate the URL (the 'path' after our domain) with JavaScript, which changes what we see on the screen when the URL changes or when a link is clicked, WITHOUT                                                sending a request to the server to render a new HTML file (ie: fetch a new HTML file).
                                                             [Page (URL) changes are handled by client-side (React) code]
                                               ‚≠ê‚≠ê Instead, React blocks that browser default to send a request to the server, and it updates whats visible on the screen with client-side JavaScript (React).

/ ` Installing React Router `

    - 'React Router' lets us create multi-page React applications. 
    
    - It provides Client-side Routing. So Routing functionalities in our client-side React app.
    
    - Remember -> Routing means that different paths in the URL, loads different pages
    
    
    
    - run 'npm i react-router-dom@5'      ->   installs React Router version 5.       ‚≠ê change to 'npm i react-router-dom@6' after learning about version 6. ‚≠ê
                               
                               
                           
                               
                               
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ ` Defining & using Routes `
    
    - We want to handle 'paths' after the domain, to render different components on to the screen
            
                   ie: 'www.our-domain.com/'                --> render component A
                       'www.our-domain.com/products'        --> render component B
                       
    - We could just use React and state to render different components when the URL path changes and prevent the default browser behavior of sending a request to a server when a link is clicked,
                but 'react-router-dom' package does all that for us.
                               
    - The 'react-router-dom' package makes registering different routes or 'paths' in the URL, and rendering different content for a certain path    -->   very very EASY.
                               
                               
                               
         „Ä∞  Import 'Route' component from 'react-router-dom'  -> import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';  
                      The 'Route' component allows us to define a certain 'path', and then the react component that should be rendered when that 'path' becomes active in the URL.
                      
                      
         ---------- '<Route />' component  ----------
         
                  - '<Route />' component element takes a 'path="..."' prop, which will be the path in the URL.
                           ie: '  <Route path="/home" />  '  --> this means that this route should become active when we have '/home' in our URL  'www.our-domain.com/home'
       
                  - Then in between the opening and closing '<Route path="/home">...</Route>' component element, we add the component element for the component that we want to render when the URL path is equal                                to the value of the 'path="..."' prop.
                             The '<Route/>' component will make sure that the component in between its opening and closing tags, is ONLY rendered on the screen when the URL path is equal to the value of its 'path="..."'                              props (ie: when the Route is active).

                - To be able to use the '<Route />' component and other React router fetaures in our app, we need to wrap our root component '<App/>' with the '<BrowserRouter/>' compoennt provided by                                        'react-router-dom' package.
                           
                - 'paths' that are not defined in the '<Route path="/home">...</Route>' component element, will not render anything on the page.

/ ` Working with Links `
      
        ---------- Adding Links that takes us to different pages  ----------
          
                           üõëüõë This approach has a BIG FLAW üõëüõë
    - If we add standard links / anchor tags to take us to other pages in the App, the traditional way like so üëáüëá, instaed of rendering different components on the page, the link will load a *NEW HTML page*, because we will be sending a brand new request to the server as if we are using a traditional multi-page application. Which is NOT what we want.
    
          üëÜ This works, but it means we leave the active Single-page application, we start a new one and lose any application states that we might have had in the application üëÜ
                             Which goes against the idea of building a Single-page application.
                             
 
          // ------ üõëüõë Flaw example üõëüõë ------
                             
                              import React from "react";
                             
                              const Header = () => {
                                return (
                                  <header>

         üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ  To prevent this behavior, we can use the '<Link/>' component provided by 'react-router-dom'  üëáüëáüëáüëá
                             
                             
         
        ---------- '<Link/>' component  ----------
                             
                             
      - The '<Link/>' component takes in a 'to="/about"' which holds the address or path that we want to navigate to.
                       ie:  ' <Link to="/about">About</Link> '
      
      - React router will render an anchor tag to the DOM from the '<Link/>' component.
      - React router will then listen to clicks on this anchor tag (generated from the '<Link/>' component), and prevents the browser default of sending a request to the server and loading a new HTML page. 
                             
      - React router will manually update the URL for us so it looks like we switched to a new page when in reality it renders the component that belongs to the URL path, to the screen.  (Fake Navigation)
            So with '<Link/>' components --> 1. We dont send new requests to the server, 
                                             2. We stay on the loaded Single-page application,
                                             3. We dont loose any state by loading a new HTML page
                                             4. And we give the user the illusion of switching to a different pages.

  - A special version of the '<Link/>' component that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
                             
    - To highlight the ACTIVE link of the page, React Router has a component that helps us with that, which is the '<NavLink/>' component. 
          So we can use the '<NavLink/>' component for Navbar links which works exactly like the '<Link/>' component, with the difference that  üëá
          
          „Ä∞ '<NavLink/>' component have an 'activeClassName' prop which takes in a classname that gets added to the NavLink whenever that link is active, ie: whenever we are on the page that the NavLink belongs to.

                             - üìù SideNote if we dont specify an 'activeClassName="selected"' props. The class 'active' automatically gets added to the active '<NavLink/>'

'<Route>' is used to define a path for your page components or views whereas a '<Link>' is used to define an anchor element to link the pages of the components with each other but '<Link>' makes sure that when you switch between pages, the page does not reloads, instead there is a switch between views on the same index.html that gets loaded in the browser.

/ ` Adding Dynamic Routes with Params `
                             

    - If we have a list of products and we want to always load the same page for them (a Product Details page) but with different content for each product we click on, we can use 'dynamic routes'. 
      
                    So we are rendering the same component when we click on a product link, but we are dynamically displaying different content on it.
                      To do so we need to tell React Router for which product should the Product Detail page be loaded to, so the right data can be displayed  üëá 
                    
                    To do so we can define 'dynamic routes' by: 
        
                          - Creating a '<Route/>' component with a ' path="..." ' attribute that takes us to the Product Details page, and then use a special syntax -->

/ ` Using 'switch' and 'exact' for configuring Routes `  
                             
                             [ALWAYS USE '<Switch/>' component to prevent rendering muliplte pages at the same time in our App]  <-- This is due to just how React router works. It loads ALL paths that match the current Route -> and in React router match means the start of the path, all paths after that is ignored. ie:
                                                    üëá ---> start path
                                    <Route path="/products">
                                            &&                                     React router will set both of these routes to active since their start paths are the same. 
                                    <Route path="/products/:productId">
                                      
                             üëÜüëÜ To prevent this and always have one ACTIVE route, we use '<Switch/>' component and 'exact' prop üëÜüëÜ
                             
    - The '<Switch>' component looks through all of its child routes and it displays the first one whose 'path' matches the current URL. 
          ‚≠ê This component is what we want to use in most cases for most applications, because we have multiple routes and multiple plate pages in our app but we only want              to show one page at a time.
          
        - üìù SIDE NOTE: URL paths basically work like a folder structure, so if we have a 'products' page that open up a 'product-details' page when we click on a product, then we write the path in the '<Route>' like                this üëá
                                              üëáüëá
                              <Route path="/products/:productId">   // URL WILL BE --->  '  our-domain.com/products/<any value>  '           
                                   <ProductsDetails />
                              </Route>
                             
                             
                             
                             üõë‚úã‚õî INSTEAD of this ‚õî‚úãüõë
                             
                                                üëáüëáüëá
                              <Route path="/product-detail/:productId">   // URL WILL BE --->  '  our-domain.com/product-detail/<any value>  '            
                                   <ProductsDetails />
                              </Route>
                             
                             
                             
    „Ä∞Ô∏è If we just use '<Switch>' component, React router will activate the FIRST route that matches the URL, no matter how specific our paths are (so in order).
    
            // URL  --->  '  our-domain.com/products/<any value>  '
    
                           <Switch>           üëáüëá -> start path
                             <Route path="/products">                               ----> üü¢ `This Route will be ACTIVE`
                                   <ProductsDetails />                      
                              </Route>
                                                üëáüëáüëá
                              <Route path="/products/:productId">             ---> `This Route will NOT be active even tho its more specific`
                                   <ProductsDetails />

                            <Switch>
    
    
            üëÜüëÜ To avoid this we use the 'exact' prop available on '<Route/>' components üëÜüëÜ
   - The 'exact' prop, avaialabe on '<Route/>' components, disables the partial matching for a route and makes sure that it only returns the route if the path is an EXACT match to the current url.

/ ` Working with Nested Routes ` 
                             

    - We are not limited to defining <Route/> in one place only in the App. We can define new Routes in defferent pages as well (Nested Routes). 
    
    - If these Nested Routes are in a component that is currently active, then React Router will evaluate these Nested Routes.
    
    - So we can define Routes '<Route/>' in other components/pages. Then load more content if we have a more specific path in those pages.

/ ` Adding a '404' page ` 
                
                
    
   - If the user enters a totally unknown Route in the URL (a Route that we didnt specify in the 'path' prop in '<Route path="...">' component) --> then the page content will be ‚¨ú BLANK/EMPTY.     
   
          üëÜüëÜüëÜ In this situations, in the real world, we want to display a '404' page, that tells the user that this page doesnt exist, instead of just showing a blank page.
          
    - So if the user enters an unsupported path in the URL, we can show a '404' page by:
                             1. Adding a fallback '<Route/>' component at the end of our '<Switch/>' statement which will be a fallback if none of the Routes above it match.
                             2. This fallback '<Route/>' should have a ' path="*" ' props with a '*' character as a value, which is a wildcard path that signals to React Router that this Route should match for ANY/ALL                                   paths/URLs in the App.
                                    - So this Route ' <Route path="*"/> ' will MATCH for ALL URLs, which is why we put it at the end of the '<Switch/>' so that it doesnt consume one of the Requests to the actual Routes                                            defined above it, in the '<Switch/>'.

/ ` using 'useHistory' Hook    -->  to Programmatically (Imperatively) navigate user to a different page  ` 
                             
    
      - 'useHistory' hook allows us to change the browser history of pages the user visited. 
            It gives us access to the history instance which we may use to navigate to different pages.
            
      - ‚≠ê To navigate to a new page using 'useHistory' hook  ->  
                - we either use the 'push' method on the returned 'useHistory' object, which pushes a new page to the stack of pages in our history
                - or we can use the 'replace' method, which replaces the current page
                
                Difference between 'push' & 'replace' methods on the history object, is that with 'push' we can go back with the back button to the page we are coming from, but with 'replace' method we CANT.
                
                So 'replace' is like 'redirect' where we change the current page, whereas 'push' adds a NEW page.

                              üåü use 'push' to implement programmatic navigation with React Router.

/ `  '<Prompt/>' component   ` 


  - Used to prompt the user before navigating away from a page, just like 'prompt()' method in Vanilla JavaScript.
          When your application enters a state that should prevent the user from navigating away (like a form is half-filled out), render a <Prompt> component.
          
  - The '<Prompt/>' component takes in two props: 
                             - 'when' prop where we pass in 'true' or 'false' defining whether this Prompt should be shown or not, depending on whether the user changes the URL or not. 
                                   so if 'isFormFocued' is true, the prompt will be shown if the user tries to leave the page, in example shown below üëáüëá.
                                   
                             - 'message' prop which takes in a function that should return a string with the text that we want to show to the user, if they try to leave.
                                      In this function we get the 'location' object which hold information about the page we are trying to go to. This would allow us to include the path of the page we are going to in the                                       message string we are showing the user.
                                      
                                        ie: '  <Prompt when={isFormFocused} message={(location) =>`Are you sure you want to leave? '${location.pathname}' page`};  '

/ `  Query paramaters  ` 


  - Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url. 
          They are extensions of the URL that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed.
          
  - Query parameters start with a question mark '?' and then folowed by parameter pairs 'sort=ascending' which pass extra data into the page that was loaded. ie: 'https.://www/domain.com/page?sort=ascending'
                        
                                                        query string begins from '?' mark

  -- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Difference between 'Query paramaters' ('?sort=ascending')   &&   'Regular Route paramaters' ('/page/:quoteId') is that  -->  
                      - 'Regular paramaters' are MANDATORY. Where pages specified in the <'Route/>' component are ONLY rendered when the Route MATCHES. 
                      - whereas 'Query paramaters' are optional. The '?' does not change the Route matching and has no impact on which Route is matched. 
                              But if a Route is matched then the loaded page would have access to the 'Query paramater' data, to for instance change the behavior of the page that was loaded.
                                  like sorting a list on a page by ascending or descending order.

// SIDE NOTE: 
    
    - We can use the built-in JavaScript 'URLSearchParams()' constructor function on Query Parameters, which we get using 'useLocation' hook,
            which will return an object that containg key/value pairs of the query paramater key and its value.
            
            
    - We can use the 'get()' method on the returned Object and pass in the key of the Query parameter, which gives us its value.

/ `  'useRouteMatch' Hook   `


    - The 'useRouteMatch' hook, similar to 'useLocation' hook but has more information about the currently loaded Route.
    
    - We can use the 'useRouteMatch' hook to get the path defined by US and not just the one in the URL.    ie: dynamic path defined by us  -->  'quotes/:quoteId'

// ----------------------
/ ` Difference between 'useRouteMatch' hook and 'useLocation' hook `
    
    'useLocation' hook

    Provides access to the location prop in React Router.

    It is similar to 'window.location' in the browser itself, but this is accessible everywhere as it represents the Router state and location.

    A primary use case for this would be to access the 'query params', ie: '?sort=ascending',  or the complete route string through 'pathname' property.

    ------

    'useRouteMatch' hook

    Provides access to the match object.

    If it is provided with no arguments, it returns the closest match in the component or its parents.

    A primary use case would be to construct nested paths.



   ‚≠ê SO, - 'location.pathname' gives the URL of the current page, 
          - while 'match.url' gives the path you gave to the '<Route>' that is rendering the page.

            ‚õî  <Switch>
                  <Route path='/welcome'>                                            <-- 'React-Router-v5'
                    <Welcome />
                  </Route>
                  <Route path='/products' exact>
                    <Products />
                  </Route>
                  <Route path='/products/:productId'>
                    <ProductDetail />
                  </Route>
                </Switch>
      

        -> ‚≠ê  we use 'element' prop in 'React-Router-v6' to pass in the component element that should be rendered if the route 'path' matches as *JSX* 
                      ie: 

           üü¢  <Routes>                                                                                   
                  <Route path="/welcome" element={<Welcome />} />                                        <-- 'React-Router-v6'       
                  <Route path="/products" exact element={<Products />} />
                  <Route path="/products/:productId" element={<ProductDetail />} />
               </Routes>
                                 
                                                                                   
              
                      
      ---------------------                  
    3. Dynamic path paramters did NOT change in 'React-Router-v6'
                                            üëáüëá
              ie: <Route path='/products/:productId'>                     -> 'React-Router-v5'
                    <ProductDetail />
                  </Route>


               '<Route path='/products/:productId' element={<ProductDetail/>} />'            -> 'React-Router-v6'
                                         üëÜüëÜüëÜ
                      
  
      ---------------------
    4. In 'React-Router-v6' we no longer need the 'exact' keyword in the '<Route>' component.                                  üëáüëá
                'React-Router-v6' now ALWAYS looks for exact matches if we define a 'path' like this     ->     '<Route path="/products" element={<Products />} /> '

                üõëüõë NEVER USED üõëüõë
      --  If we want the old behavior in 'React-Router-v5' of matching the atsrt of a path only. 
            Then multiple page components that start with the same path will be rendered at the same time.   This behavior happens in 'React-Router-v5' if we dont include the 'exact' prop.
                        -> then we can use '*' at the end of the 'path' in 'React-Router-v6'             
                        
                        ie:  ' <Route path="/products/*" element={<Products />} /> '


      ---------------------
    5. Unlike in 'React-Router-v5', the order inwhich we specify '<Route>' components does NOT matter anymore in 'React-Router-v6'.
                              'React-Router-v6' has a better algorithim that nows if we have a more specfic 'path' in one of our '<Route>' components, it will then match that Route and ignore the other '<Route>' paths                                       regardless of their ORDER, even if we use '*' on one of paths. If one is more specific than the others, then its the only one that will match.
            
            
                              <Routes>
                                <Route path="/welcome" element={<Welcome />} />                
                                <Route path="/products/*" element={<Products />} />                               
                                <Route path="/products/:productId" element={<ProductDetail />} />                           üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà  This <Route> will match for this URL 'http://localhost:3000/products/p1'
                              </Routes>                                                                                                               even tho the <Route> above it is using '*' AND id above it.


      ---------------------
   6. '<NavLink>' component now does not need the 'activeClassName' prop in 'React-Router-v6'. An 'active' class is automatically added to the navlink if the Route path matches its ' to="..." ' value.
   
            If we want to apply a specific class other than the default one 'active', when the NavLink is active, 
                            then we would need to manually check if the NavLink is active through the 'className' props, using an arrow function like so üëáüëá
                ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê This arrow funtion will contain information about the NavLink and the current state of the naviagtion. We can access this information though an argument in the arrow function.

                                      üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá
        ie: ' <NavLink className={(navData) => (navData.isActive ? classes.active : "")} to="/welcome">
                Welcome
              </NavLink> '


      ---------------------
   7. In 'React-Router-v6', the '<Redirect>' component doesnt exist anymore.
              Instead of '<Redirect>', now there is a '<Navigate>' component in 'React-Router-v6', which is used to redirect the user to a different path if a certain path is matched.
              NOTE: we pass the '<Navigate>' component in the 'element={...}' prop. And also remember we dont need the 'exact' keyword in 'React-Router-v6'.
              
                
              ie:    <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/welcome" />} />                    `  <-- DONT USE THIS üõë `

  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  IMPORTANT: If we redirect the user like this üëÜüëÜ. Then we will 'PUSH' two pages on to the history stack, one for the 'path="/"' and one for the 'path="/welcome"' path when the user gets redirected. 
            If we truly want to redirect the user and not clutter the navigation/history stack with unwanted paths, then we can 'REPLACE' the current page by using the 'replace' prop in the '<Navigate>' component.
            
              ie:    <Route path="/" element={<Navigate replace to="/welcome" />} />               ` <-- USE THIS üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢ `
                                                  üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ
           
              
      ---------------------        
    8. Nested routes syntax in 'React-Router-v6' is different from that in 'React-Router-v5'.
    
           - instead of passing the nested '<Route>' in a child component like this in 'React-Router-v5' üëáüëáüëá
                
                  // --- child component
                    const Welcome = () => {                                     
                      return (
                        <>
                          <h1>The Welcome Page</h1>

                          <Route path="/welcome/user-login" exact>    üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà              <-- 'React-Router-v5'
                            <p>This is a nested Route</p>                     üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà
                          </Route>                                          üëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëàüëà
                        </>
                      );
                    };

                    export default Welcome;


                  // -----
                       
            - We now need to use the '*' at the end of the parent Route ' <Route path="/welcome/*" element={<Welcome />} /> ', because we want the '<Welcome>' component to load WHENEVER our URL path starts with                          '/welcome', no matter whats comes after it, it will always be loaded when the path starts with '/welcome'.
                We also want the nested Route component to load along with the parent route component. On the same page.
                             Since 'react-router-dom-v6' looks for exact match for the path, by default.

            - Another change in 'react-router-dom-v6' nested routes is that nested routes are RELATIVE to their parent route, which means that we DONT need to repeat the parameter of the parent followed by the nested                    route parameter for the path, when creating nested routes. 
                      ‚≠ê So the component inside the nested route will only be active WHEN the component inside the PARENT route is active.
                            So we dont need to use 'useMatch' or 'useLocation' etc.. to find the path of the parent for nested routes anymore.   
                                                                                                  ie:  ->  ' <Link to={`${match.path}/new-user`} '    `Like we had to do in 'React-Router-v5'`
                        üìù SIDE NOTE: Child '<Link>' components 'to' prop is also RELATIVE to its parent route 'path' prop.
                            
                        ie: 
                       ---- instead of this üëá  in 'react-router-dom-v5'  ----
                          
                           // ---- parent route
                                <Switch>         üëáüëá
                                  <Route path="/welcome">                       <-- 'react-router-dom-v5'
                                    <Welcome />
                                  </Route>
                                <Switch> 
                          
                          // ---- child route 
                                        üëáüëá
                          <Route path="welcome/user-login" exact>
                            <p>Welcome, New User!</p>
                          </Route>


                                            ---- we now do this üëá in 'react-router-dom-v6'  ----

             - ‚≠ê‚≠ê  In 'React-Router-v6', we can now add nested Routes INSIDE parent routes '<Route/>', instead of having them in the child component or component where we want to load the nested route content.
                                       USE THIS. Having all our route definitions in one place is alot better.
                                                                                 
                                                                                  
              - üåüüåü If we use this pattern, we HAVE to tell React-router where the content inside the nested route 'element={...}' should be inserted into the dom, using the '<Outlet/>' component.
                    '<Outlet/>' component will act as a placeholder, which tells react-router where nested route content should be inserted.

           'useNavigate' hook
    8. 'Imperative navigation'.   Some times we want to navigate when an action is finished, when a button was clicked, when an http request was sent, etc...
    
            --- In 'React-router-v5' we can do so by using the 'useHistory' hook along with the 'push()' or 'replace()' methods available on them. 
                          ie: ' const history = useHistory(); '
                              '  history.push(); '                    `  --> navigates user to a new page.  `
                              
                              
            --- In 'React-router-v6'  'useHistory' hook does NOT EXIST anymore. Instead we can use the 'useNavigate' hook.    
                          ie: ' const navigate = useNavigate(); '
                              '  navigate('/welcome/new-user'); '                    `  --> navigates user to a the' /welcome/new-user ' path  `
                              
                If we want to redirect using the 'useNavigate' hook. We can do so
                        ie:  const navigate = useNavigate();
                             navigate('/welcome/new-user', {replace: true});   
                                                                 üëÜüëÜüëÜ        --> ` Will replace the new route with the old one. instead of pushing the old route to the navigation stack. ie: Will redirect the user  `
                                                                 
                                                                
                We can also pass in a number inside the 'useNavigate' hook, for instance like '-1' to go the previous page, or '1' to go forward, or '3' to forward three time, etc...
                        ie:  const navigate = useNavigate();
                             navigate(-1);                                    --> ` goes back `

    - During development we work on React Apps locally. 
            When we build a website we want to push it to a server, so that users can access it.
            
            
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ Deployment steps üëá     [How to push it to real server]
                                 
    1. Test code
    
    2. Optimize code   --  For instance adding 'Lazy Loading' using 'React.lazy()' method and 'Suspense' react built-in component.
    
    3. 'Build' app for production   --  By executing a script written for us by React to convert all the JS code to code that the browser understands. 
              - The script will output a production ready bundle for our code, which is minified and automatically optimized to be as small as possible. We can then take that optimized output bundle and move it to a                     server which will serve it to users in a highly optimized code package.
              
    4. Upload Production code to Server  --  Deploy our production package to a server. Different hosting providers we can choose from.
    
    5. Configure our server or hosting provider 
    
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
    / ` Steps above explaned `
    
    2. Optimize code   -->  For instance adding 'Lazy Loading' which means load code only when its needed. Easy to implement when using routing. Using 'React.lazy()' method and 'Suspense' react built-in component.
                          
                       - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> With a React Single-Page Application, in the end we build one big JavaScript bundle, and that entire bundle needs to be downlaoded by every user when ever they visit the app. 
                                                'React.lazy()' method and 'Suspense' component makes the initial javascript bundle to be downloaded, smaller which makes the initial app load speed faster for user.

                                                               - The 'static' folder in the 'build' folder contains our optimized js and css files.
                                                      
                                      „Ä∞ 'npm run serve'  -> We can then run this script to preview the production app on our local machine.
                             
                 
                                      
                                 
    4. Upload Production code to Server  --> A React static page application (or any SPA no matter what framework we used)  is a 'STATIC website'. Which means that it is only made up of HTML, CSS & JavaScript ('Client-                                                side' code), there is NO server-side code involved (NO 'Node.js', 'PHP' code).
                                            
                                             - Since React apps are 'STATIC websites', we need a 'Static Site Host'. We DONT need a hosting provider that lets us run 'Server-side code' like 'Node.js' or 'PHP'. 
                                                                     Google/search for a 'Static website hosting provider' in order to find different host providers for our React application. 
                                                                                   [We used 'Firebase' in the course to host the React app]
                               
       ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê IMPORTANT -> When the Hosting provider asks ' What do you want to use as your 'public directory'? ' -> CHOOSE our app 'BUILD' folder by writing 'build' in the console.
                
              
       
       
   5. Configure our server or hosting provider   -->  Then when it asks ' Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? ' -> Write 'y' for yes. So the path in the url that the user sends as a request,                                                        is 'IGNORED' by the server and we always return our single page application code no matter what the URL was. Then let 'React-router' handle which page to render                                                                depending on the path in the URL.

                - 'File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? ' -> 'No'

 / ` Adding Authentication to React Apps `                [user sign-up, login, and logout]


        IMPORTANT LECTURE --> ' https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25889756#questions '


// ------------
  ` Why do we need Authentications? `
   
    - Authentication is needed if content should be 'protected' (ie: not accessible by everyone)
    - We need authentication in our apps, because some content should be 'protected'. Not all users and visitors of our app, should be able to access all 'content'.
    
          'Protected Content' could be:
                            „Ä∞ Pages that the user should not be able to access if they are not logged in.  
                                  Like a page that lets users change their account password for instance, which should not be accessible to users that are not logged in. 
                                  
                            „Ä∞ or Data that we are storing in a Database. Some 'API endpoint' which our React application might be sending requests to, on certain pages, which should be locked-down for non-authenticated                                      users.
                                  Like a change password request that is sent to a Database to change an authenicated user password. 
                                    So in addition to making the change password page inaccessible to unauthenticated users, we also want to lockdown the 'API endpoint' to which we are sending the change password request                                        to, so that a request sent to the this 'API endpoint' cant succeed if the user is not logged in.
                                    
                      üåü Because if that change password 'API endpoint' is NOT locked-down , then ANY user that knows the URL of that 'API endpoint' will be able to send requests to change the password of other users üåü                                        Which would be very insecure.
                                    
                        üëÜüëÜ ‚≠ê‚≠ê Which is why we dont want to just restrict access to pages on our website, but also 'API endpoints' to which we send requests to, from inside our App ‚≠ê‚≠ê üëÜüëÜ
                                  
                        
// ------------                        
    ` How does Authenication work? `
                        
    - In general, 'Authenication' is a two-step process: 
                                          1. First step is always to 'Get Access / Grant permission to the user'. 
                                                Users get access by providing their credentials, ie: by logging in, using their correent username & password. (After creating an account) 
                                            
                                                  
                                          2. Second step, is to 'Send the Request to a protected resource'
                                                 That log in data /credentials is then sent to a server where we can look into a Databse and verify the log-in credentials 
                                                   -> and if the credentials are valid then the server/backend to which the request is sent to, grants access/permission to the user.
                                                   
                                         Once the user has access/permission, we can unlock certain pages in the app and/or use that permission to send subsequent requests to other protected resources on an API endpoint.
                                            
                                     üåü  So we first 'grant the permission' and 'then we can send more requests to other endpoints with that permission attached'  üåü
                                     
                            So in reality,
                                  1. We would have a 'client with a React App' running in the browser and a 'BackEnd Server' with some server-side code written by us or by a Third-party API.
                                  2. After the user enters their credentials, we would send a request to the server with an email/passwrod combination. 
                                  3. The server then verifies those credentails. And then either 'Grants' permission for further requests or 'Denies' permission.
                             
                                                                  `Is that enough?? üëÜ`
                                             
                     ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚õî   NO. Thats not enough. The 'Granted permission' CANT just be a 'yes' or a 'no' to then grant access to protected resources, like API endpoints   ‚õî ‚≠ê‚≠ê
                                                      BECAUSE a 'yes' or a 'no' response from the server to grant access to the user, is 'EASY TO FAKE'.
                  If the server to which the user sends their credentials would just reply by a 'yes' or 'no', then any user with coding skills could just skip that step of getting the permission and instead add their                         OWN 'yes' or 'no' to requests for protected resources.
                  
                  
              ---- üü° Which is why a simply 'yes' or 'no' response from the server is not enough. And Authentication is a bit more elaborate than that.
              
              The part of sending and checking the user credentials, still need to happen. BUT the response sent back by the server to the client, MUST BE MORE THAN just a 'yes' or 'no'. 
              
                Here there are TWO main aproaches that are commonly used in the industry when sending back authentication response from the server to the client (identifying a clinet to the server) üëá: 

                        1. 'Server-side Sessions'           [üî¥ Not best for Single-page Applications]
                               - Server-side Sessions is a very traditional approach of handling authentication. And a great approach.
                               - With Server-side Sessions, once a server grants the user access, that server 'Generates' and 'STORES' a UNIQUE identifier for that specific user/client that was granted access.
                                  And so every user on the website who authenticates, gets their own unique identifier stored on the server.
                               - But that identifier is NOT just stored in the server, it is also 'sent back' to the client. 
                                  üåü So the response sent back from the server is not just a 'yes' or 'no' to grant access, but instead it also contains that UNIQUE identiifier.
                                        So the 'server' AND the 'client' both parties know that UNIQUE identifier.
                                        
                               - Since the server knows that client identifier, that identifier cannot be faked. 
                                  If we comeup with our own random identifier, the server wont recognize it, and access will be denied for that request.
                                  
                             üõë DISADVANTAGE of this mecahnism -->     „Ä∞ Server-side Sessions works great if the Back-End and Front-End are 'tighly COUPLED'. 
                                                                        „Ä∞ But if we have 'Decoupled Ends', ie: 
                                                                                - If we have our Single-page application served by server 'A' 
                                                                                - AND Back-End application (REST-API) served by server 'B'
                                                                                    Then there is NO 'tight coupling'
                                                                        „Ä∞ The Back-End API should probably work independently from the Fron-End Single-page Application and Vice-Versa.
                                                                            Because for instance, if we are building an API that is there to be used by many websites like the Goole maps API, then that API cant be                                                                                      'tightly coupled' and focused on one specific front-end. Instead it need to stay flexible.
                                                                            
                                            WHICH is why we then dont want to store an identifier in the server. The server should be stateless. And not store that kind of data about the connected clients.
                                            
                                          üî¥üî¥üî¥üî¥   This is why 'Server-side Sessions' is not the best option for Single-Page applications   üî¥üî¥üî¥üî¥
                                    Because Back-End AND Front-End would need to be 'tighly coupled', which is not the case in most Single-Page applications
                                            

                        2. 'Authentication Tokens'        [üü¢ Good mechanism choice for Single-page Applications]
                        
                              - With Authentication Tokens, the user still sends their credentials (email & password) to a Back-End server, and the server validates those credentials by comparing the email/passwrod                                          combination to whats stored in the Database, and then sends back a response.
                              - If the credentials are valid, the server 'GENERATES' a 'permission token', which is a very long string with some data encoded in to that string. 
                                  The server will use some algorithm to encode some data like the username & password into one string, which can be decoded back into these individual pieces of data.
                                    üåüüåü   The server DOES NOT 'STORE' that generated 'permission token'  üåüüåü
                                    
                              - That 'permission token' will be generated by the server with a 'private KEY' which will be used for hashing that data into a string. üåü That 'private KEY' is only known by the server üåü
                                        üåü  So the 'permission token' 'private KEY' is only known by the server, NOT by the client   üåü
                                        
                              - That 'permission token' is sent back to the client by the server, but only the server knows how to generate that token, because of that 'private KEY' which is only known by the server.
                                 
              ‚≠ê‚≠ê  So when sending a request to the server, the React App attaches that 'permission token' to future requests inorder to access protected resources on the server. 
                      And then the server uses the 'private key', which only it knows, to verify that the 'permission token' attached to the request sent by the client, is VALID   ‚≠ê‚≠ê
                      
                      If the 'permission token' was faked or created using a different 'private KEY', then the server will detect this and deny access to the client.
                      
              
                  üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢  'Authentication Tokens' is an approach that allows for 'DECOUPLING' of Front-End and Back-End, which is why it the best approach to use with Sinle-page Applications  üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢
                  
                  
                  Note from instructor ->   `  When working with "Authentication Tokens", these tokens are typically created in the "JSON Web Token" Format (JWT).

                                               As explained in the previous lecture, those "tokens" are really just long strings which are constructed by an algorithm that encodes data into a string (with help of a                                                      private key, only known by the server).

                                               You can learn more about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) here: https://jwt.io/  `
                  
                  
                  
// -------------------------
/ `  Is it safe to expose our Api key in the fetch method to the frontend js code?  `
   

 Absolutely not. It is not difficult for someone who has access to your to find the key. In a real app, the key would be stored somewhere in the backend. During authentication, you would send the user info and password via HTTPS to the backend and the backend responds with a token (JWT) which is valid for a limited time. The backend will only accept requests which has a valid token attached and if a request has the proper token, only then backend will the backend do the requested action i.e. firebase CRUD.

/ `  What is NextJS   ` 

    
   - NextJS is a 'React Framework for Production' OR a 'FULLSTACK framework for ReactJS '

   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which means its a third-party package that we can add to Front-End projects, so its all about client-side JavaScript code in the end.
   - We can use React to build interactive user interfaces. Its a library that makes building complex user interfaces way easier than it would be with just JavaScript.
   
   - React is called a 'library' because in its core, its really just focusing on the user interface part, ie: on components, states, props.
      If we want to build a large application, we would need to use other third-party libraries for routing, authentication, etc...
   
   - 'NextJS', on the other hand, is a 'Framework' buit on top of ReactJS.

    - The difference between a 'framework' and a 'library' in the end, is that a 'framework' is bigger, has more features than a library. It focuses on more things reather than just small things. 
    - 'Frameworks' also gives us clear guidance / rules on how we should write our code, how we should structure our files, and so on.
    
    
   - 'NextJS' solves common problems, enhances ReactJS, and makes building react apps easier by having many core features out of the box which we would otherwise have to add to React apps on our own, otherwise. 
        These key features in NextJS, ensures that we dont have to reinvent the wheel as often, we dont have to add as many third-party libraries to solve common problems which we need when building real production React apps.
        
        üëÜüëÜ That is why 'NextJS' is called a 'Framework'. Because it has alot of built-in features that help us solve alot of problems & clear guidance on how to use those features.  üëÜüëÜ

/ `  Key Features of NextJS   ` 
        
        
        
  1. üü¢ Key Feature 1  ->  '  Built-in Server side Rendering (Improved SEO!!)  '    [‚≠ê MOST important keyfeature of 'NextJS' ‚≠ê]

    - 'Server-side Rendering' is all about preparing the content of a page on the 'server' instead of on the 'client'.
  
    -  If we take a standard React application, built with just React, and inspect the source code (right click -> 'view page source'), we will notice that the page is almost empty, with just the basic HTML skeleton.            None of our React components is rendered.
         
    -  Since all of the rendering is done by React, and React is a 'client-side' JavaScript library  ->  all of that rendering is done on the 'client' / in the browser of the user, NOT on the 'server'.
        üåü And as a result, the actual HTML code which is sent FROM the 'server' to the 'client' when a user visits our page, is pretty empty with no content.
        
    - üëÜ Depending on the type of app we are building, this could be a problem for a couple of reasons:
    
        „Ä∞ If our app fetches some data from a server that should be displayed, then the user might initially see a loading state / a flickering page for a fraction of a second while the request is on it way fetching the            data from the server. 
       üåü Because data fetching only begins once the JavaScript is executed on the 'client', and then we still have to wait for the response of that ongoing 'request'. Simply because the page that we requested from the               server, did not yet contain that data.
       
       „Ä∞ 'Client-side rendering' might also be a problem if ' Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) ' is important in the App.
          This does not matter for all pages, if we have an administration dashboard that is only rwched by logging in, then search engine optimization does not matter, because Search engines will never see that dashboard.  Its highly user specific and we need to login anyways which is 'client-side redering'.
          
          
          But if we a blog page with alot of content that should be found through 'Search Engines', then ' Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) ' DOES matter. So we would need to render pages on the 'server' so that the 'Search Engine Crawlers' would be able to reach the content on the page. Otherwise if we just use standard React, then 'Search Engine Crawlers' will only see any content on the HTML page fetched from the server.
          
          This is where 'Server-side Rendering' could help us. If that page would be pre-rendered on the server, if that data-fetching could be done on the server when a request hits that server, and then the finished/rendered page would be served to users and to 'Search Engine Crawlers'   ->  then users wouldnt see the flickering loading page as data is fetched AND 'Search Engines' would see out page content which is best for ' Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) '.
          
         üëÜ üåüüåü These are problems that 'Server-side Rendering' solves  ->  it allows us to 'pre-render' React pages and components ON a 'server' üåüüåü
         
    
    - 'ReactJS' actually has its own built-in features that allows us to add 'server-side rendering', but it can be tricky to get that right and requires extra setup from our side.
    
    - üåü With 'NextJS', 'server-side rendering' becomes way easier, because 'NextJS' has built-in 'server-side rendering'. 
          It automatically 'pre-renders' our pages. Which means that with 'NextJS', if we build a standard 'NextJS' app without ANY extra setup from our side, those pages will be 'pre-rendered' on the server by default and out of the box.
        Which means that:
              „Ä∞ it is great for ' Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) ' because 'Search Engine Crawlers' are able to see the content on the page.
              „Ä∞ And our users have a better inital load experience because they dont have that inital flickering loading state.
              
        If we inspect the source code (right click -> 'view page source') of a 'NextJS' page, then we will se that it is not just an HTML skeleton with no content, but instead all our page content is already there, in the HTML page which we got back from the 'server'.
        
        
    - With 'NextJS', after the initial load of the page, we still get a React App (SPA) running in the browser. To have this fast/interactive user experience which we typically want to offer with ReactJS

    
    -------
    2. üü° Key Feature 2  ->  ' Simplified Routing with File-Based Routing  '

  - Remember 'Routing' means giving the user the illusion of having multiple pages.
      The 'Router' basically watches the URL, and when it changes, it prevents the browser default of sending a request to some BackEnd server and instead renders different content/component(s) on the page with React.

       We change whats visible on the screen based on the URL, without sending an extra request to the server. Because we stay in the Single-Page application which we typically build with React.

  - With just ReactJS, 'Routing' is setup using 'react-router' in code ('<Switch/>', etc...).
  
  - üåü 'NextJS' gets rid of in-code route definitions, instead with 'NextJS' we define pages and routes with 'files' and 'folders'.
        We have a special folder in 'NextJS' apps which *HAVE* to be named 'pages', and then our structure in that folder defines the routes and paths our page supports.
        
        
        
  -------
    3. üü° Key Feature 3  ->  ' Buil Full-Stack applications  '

  - 'NextJS' makes it easy for us as developers to add BackEnd code to our React project. 
      So to build a Fullstack React project, where we dont just have the Client-Side code (maybe with server-side pre-rendering), but we also have standalone BackEnd code that for example works with the file-base system or reaches out to a Database.
     
     With 'NextJS' its very easy to add our own BackEnd API into our React app, usinf 'nodeJS' code.
     
  - So with 'NextJS' we dont have to build a standalone/seperate Rest API app, but instead we can work on one project which contains both:
        our 'Client-Side' code (Front-End code) **AND** our BackEnd API code using 'NodeJS'.

    run -> 'npx create-next-app@latest'




// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ `  NextJS folder structure   ` 
        
   - 'pages' folder [Most important]  -> Where we setup File-Based routing. Where we define the different pages which should make up the application.
   
        
   - 'Public' folder -> Holds public resources our page might use, like images.
   
            üåü Unlike in a regular React app where we have an 'index.html' file in the 'Public' folder, in 'NextJS' 'Public' folder we DONT have an html file.
                  The reason for this is that 'NextJS' has this built-in 'pre-rendering' which still gives us a Single-page application, but that Single-page application is dynamically rendered when a request reaches a                          server, so that we return an inital page with content.    
                üåü   To be precise, 'NextJS' allows us to determine WHEN a page should be pre-rendered.   üåü

   - 'styles' folder -> Holds some style files
   
   
   
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ `  NextJS Routing  `
   
   
   - in 'pages' folder, where we define our File-based routing: 
        
            üåü  file names in 'pages' folder will be used as 'paths' after the domain, with the exception of 'index.js'. 
                    These files will be used to create 'Routes', which loads the components inside them when the Route path matches the URL.   üåü 

        1. 'index.js' file ia a special file name which will be our Homepage. ie: if the URL doesnt have any parameters/slug after the domain   -->   'www.ourdomain.com'
        
        2. 'news.js' file   -->  'www.ourdomain.com/news'

   **** What goes inside those files is our standard React component which will be rendered when the 'path' matches the URL. 
          These React components must be exported so that 'NextJS' can detect them (ie: 'export default HomePage;')

/ `  Nested Paths & Pages (Nested Routes)  `

            So if we create a 'news' subfolder in 'pages' folder, and then create an 'index.js' file inside the 'news' subfolder  --> 

                                                                           `name of the subfolder`

                        „Ä∞ then that 'index.js' file 'path' will be 'www.ourdomain/news'

                        „Ä∞ and any other file that we add in the 'news' subfolder will have a nested path  -->   'www.ourdomain/news/newsdetail'

/ `  Dynamic Pages (with Parameters)  ` 
               
                                    ` nested path `
                                         üëáüëáüëá 
                   'www.ourdomain/news/newsdetail'
                        
  1. 'Creating Dynamic pages/components'

     - In the real world, we would probably have a list of news items in the 'news' page/component, and then when we click on one of these news items, it would take us to the detail page which shows the content of that specific news item that we selected.  
          So we use the same 'NewsDetail' page over and over again, for different news items to show different content.   This content would probably be fetched from a DataBase.
          
          
          üåü So HARD CODING the 'newsdetail' file name in the 'news' folder which is in the 'pages' folder, is not very Realistic, because we need that route to be dynamic.
                Instead we need to create a dynamic page where the 'path' segment in the URL is dynamic     (ie: 'dynamic paramters')


      -- To do that, we specify the file name for the Detail page (which will be used over and over again for each news item), like so üëáüëáüëá
      
            We need to tell 'NextJS' that the detail page will be 'dynamic' by using square brackets '[]' in the file name, this file will then be loaded for different values in the URL 'path'.
                Between the '[]' we can add an identifier, where the identifier name can be anything we want.
          
                                '[newsId].js'    <-- Dynamic file
                                
                                
  2. 'Extracting Dynamic Parameter values'  -->  inorder to fetch/show the correct content when a user visits a dynamic page ` using 'useRouter' hook provided by 'NextJS' `
  
  
     - To extract paramters entered in the URL, we can use the 'useRouter' hook, provided by 'NextJS'.  'useParams' in standard ReactJS with 'react-router-dom'
     
        We can use the 'query' property on the Router object, which gives us access to a nested object that contains key/value pairs.
        
             „Ä∞ keys are the 'identifier' we specified in the file name (ie: '[newsId].js') for the 'dynamic path'        

             „Ä∞ Values are whatever we enter in the URL inplace of that 'Dynamic segments'

/ `  Navigation in NextJS   --   (Linking between pages) ` 
             
             
    - To navigate between pages WITHOUT reloading the page by preventing the browser default of sending an http request to the server to fetch a new HTML page,
          we can use the '<Link/>' component provided to us by 'NextJS' which will let us stay in our Single-Page application and preserve state across pages by not losing our app-wide/component wide state, which happens if we relaod the page.  
            

      üåüüåü '<Link/>' component in NextJS functions the same way as the '<Link/>' component in standard React SPA (without 'NextJS') using 'react-router-dom' package, with the difference that 
          „Ä∞Ô∏è 'NextJS' '<Link/>' component takes in an 'href' attribute just like a regular anchor tag, 
          „Ä∞Ô∏è whereas 'react-router-dom' package '<Link/>' component takes in a 'to' attribute instead.
                                    
                  
                  
                  üìù Side note: With 'NextJS' ALL pages are rendered during build / on the server.. not just the first one loaded.

/ `  The '_app.js' File in NextJS  `
                  
                  
    - The '_app.js' in 'NextJS' is a specail file that exists in the 'pages' folder out-of-the-box. 
    
    - The '_app.js' is our app ROOT component that 'NextJS' will render (same as the 'app.js' component in 'ReactJS')

    - The 'MyApp' component inside the '_app.js' file, receives the 'Component' and 'pageProps'. 
        These props are passed into the 'MyApp' component automatically by 'NextJS', since 'NextJS' is the thing using that 'MyApp' component.
        
            „Ä∞ 'Component' prop holds the actual page content that should be rendered. 
                    So it will be different whenever we switch to a diferrent page.
                      
            „Ä∞ 'pageProps' prop are specific props the rendered page might be getting.

/ `  Programmatic (Imperative) Navigation  `   using the 'useRouter' hook


                Some times we want to navigate when an action is finished, when a button was clicked, when an http request was sent, etc...

    - Same with 'useHistory' hook (in 'react-router-v5') or 'useNavigation' hook (in 'react-router-v6'), we can use 'useRouter' hook in 'NextJS' to imperatively navigate when an action is finished.
            ie: ' const router = useRouter(); '
                   '  router.push(`/${props.id}`); '                    `  --> navigates user to a new page, by pushing/adding the URL to the browser history stack.   `

      
    
          There are other methods like 'replace()' (which replaces the to be added url with the current URL in the history stack, instead of pushing/adding it), 'back()' , 'reload()', and 'isReady()' which is set to true when the component/page is rendered,  etc.....

/ `  How Pre-Rendering works  &  What problems we face  `                     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

              [ ' standard ReactJS. WITHOUT NextJS ' ]
    - If we want to send an http request to a BackEnd server once a page/component in React is rendered, we would ussually use the 'useEffect' hook. 
          And inside the 'useEffect' hook we would add our async code to fetch data from the BackEnd. Like so: 


                const HomePage = () => {
                  const [loadedMeetups, setLoadedMeetups] = useState([]);

                  useEffect(() => {
                    const fetchData = async () => {
                      try {
                        const response = await fetch("enter database url here");

                        if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Something went wrong!!");
                        const data = await response.json();
                        // transform fetched data and store it in a variable/state

                        const transformedMeetups = data.map((meetup) => {});

                        setLoadedMeetups(transformedMeetups);
                      } catch (error) {
                        console.log(error);
                      }
                    };

                    fetchData();
                  }, []);

                  return <MeetupList meetups={loadedMeetups} />;
                };

                export default HomePage;



      - ‚≠ê‚≠ê REMEMBER, that the 'useEffect' hook gets executed AFTER its parent component function is executed/mounted, so in the SECOND render-cycle of its parent component.
      - It also only gets executed once after its parent component is mounted, that is if it has an empty dependencies array.
      - If it doesn't have an empty dependencies array, then it will get executed after its parent component is mounted/rendered, AND then everytime one of its dependencies changes.

      -- So when fetching data in standard ReactJS, without 'NextJS' like so üëÜ, the component will first be rendered with an EMPTY meetups list because the 'loadedMeetups' state is initially set to an empty array, and THEN after the 'HomePage' component is mounted/rendered the 'useEffect' hook will get executed which then:
                1. the meetup list will get fetched from the DataBase 
                2. then the 'loadedMeetups' state will update using 'setLoadedMeetups', which will cause the 'HomePage' component to be re-executed and the 'loadedMeetups' state updates will be rendered and shown in the browser.
                
                So the 'HomePage' component will have two component render cycles: 
                                  1. First, with an empty meetups list
                                  2. And second, with the fetched meetup list from the Database, since the 'loadedMeetups' state was updated.
                                  
                                  
          - ‚≠êüõë‚≠ê Two problems we might face with this usecase of fetching the data with standard ReactJS, are that: 
                1. the user would seeing a loading state as the 'HomePage' component is mounted and then the data is fetched from the database, which might not be the user experience we want. 
                2. ‚≠ê‚≠ê Secondly and more IMPORTANT, is that 'Search-Engines' will not be able to see the fetched data from the DataBase since that data is only rendered AFTER the page HTML was rendered and fetched from the server. So the meetups list will be MISSING, which is BAD for 'Search-Engine Optimization -- SEO'.
                
               üåüüåüüåü So 'NextJS' does NOT wait for data to be fetched in the 'useEffect' hook, to then return the fully pre-rendered page HTML from the server, instead 'NextJS returns the result of the FIRST component render cycle', which would not include data fetched from a database since that happens AFTER the component is mounted, ie: in the SECOND render cycle of the component. This is BAD for 'Search-Engine Optimization -- SEO' since 'crawlers' will not see that fetched data üåüüåüüåü 
               
               
               
           üü¢üü¢üü¢    To solve this problem üëÜ and pre-render a page in the server that INCLUDES fetched data from a database, we need to tell 'NextJS' to wait until the data is fetched and THEN pre-render the page in the server.   üü¢üü¢üü¢

/ `  Data Fetching and Pre-rendering in NextJS  `
           
           
           - 'NextJS' has built-in pre-rendering feature, but this feature has a FLAW (discussed above üëÜ) which is that it only pre-renders a page with the content that is present during the page/component 'FIRST' render cycle, so if we are fetching data using the 'useEffect' hook, the data fetched will not be present during the page/component pre-render since 'useEffect' hook is executed after the component/page is mounted, ie: in the 'SECOND' render cycle.
           
            So the page/component will be pre-rendered without the fetched data from the server, and then after the client/browser receives the pre-rendered HTML page  ->  the 'useEffect' hook will be executed and data will be fetched and rendered on the Client-side/browser, NOT on the server.
           
            
           - ‚≠ê After the HTML page is pre-rendered and sent to the browser by 'NextJS', 'React' takes over and the page is 'Hydrated'.
                    'Hydrated' means that React will turn the application into a 'Single-page application' and take over control of the app.
                    docs explanation -> 'Hydration' : This is the process of attaching react listeners to already-existing html dom nodes.
          
           
           - If we want to pre-render a page with fetched data so that the initial pre-rendered HTML also INCLUDES fetched data from a database, then 'NextJS' provides us with two forms of pre-rendering which we can use to control/configure how the pages should be pre-rendered. These two forms are:

                        1. 'Static-site Generation'
                        2. 'Server-side Rendering'





// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ `  Data Fetching and Pre-rendering for Static pages in NextJS   THROUGH ->  ‚≠ê [Static-site Generation] ‚≠ê `     -->    'SSG'

                                  ‚≠ê‚≠ê using 'getStaticProps()' function  ‚≠ê‚≠ê

      - 'Static-site Generation' / 'SSG' is pre-rendering your React app into HTML at build time.

      - 'Static-site Generation' is the approach we should almost use all the time in 'NextJS' apps.
      
      - ‚≠ê IMPORTANT --> When use 'Static-site Generation', a page/component is pre-rendered when we BUILD the NextJS application for production.    
                                ie: when we run the 'npm run build' script.
      
      - So with 'Static-site Generation', by default the page is not rendered on the fly on the server when a request reaches the server, instead it is pre-rendered when we as a developer build the site for production using the 'npm run build' script.

          „Ä∞Ô∏è üåüüõëüõë  This üëÜ means that after the app is built for production and deployed, the pre-rendered pages does NOT change.
                         So if we update the data fetched from a database, and we need that updated data to render on the deployed app, we would need to start the build process again and re-deploy the app again, since the HTML for the app was already pre-rendered and used in deployment.
                                  
                      [If we want the updated data to automatically render in the deployed app, 'NextJS' provides alternatives which will be explained below üëá]
                      

     -------- ` 'Static-site Generation' in NextJS` --------
      - To 'Static-site Generate' and pre-render pages with fetched data we can 'export' a special function provided by 'NextJS' called 'getStaticProps()' function, from INSIDE our page component file.
      
          -- ü§ö‚≠êüìù IMPORTANT SideNote:  The 'getStaticProps()' function ONLY works in component FILES that are inside the 'pages' folder.
                    So ONLY in our page component FILES and NOT in components located in folders other than the 'pages' folder, in the app.
                    
                    
     --------  ` How 'getStaticProps()' function works `   --------    
      - 'getStaticProps()' functions prepares 'props' for a page component before it gets executed and pre-rendered. 
                  That prepared 'props' is ussually fetched data from a database.
                  
      - 'getStaticProps()' function is allowed to be 'asynchronous', so we can return a promise when using it and THEN 'NextJS' will wait for that promise to resolve before passing its returned 'props' to the Page component function.
      This means that 'NextJS' will wait until our data is fetched, and THEN it returns that data as 'props' which will then be passed to the Page component function before it gets executed. 
      
      - With that we are able to load/fetch data BEFORE the Page component is executed, so that the Page component can be rendered WITH the required fetched data.
      
      
     -------- ` Usage of 'getStaticProps()' in NextJS` --------
      - Inside 'getStaticProps()' function, we can execute any code that would normally run on a server, like accessing a file system or securely connecting to a database, because any code we run inside the 'getStaticProps()' function will **NEVER** end up on the 'client-side' and will never execute on the 'client-side'. 
            ‚≠êüü¢ Simply because code inside the 'getStaticProps()' function is executed **ONLY** during the build process, 
                      ie: when we run the 'npm run build' script. **'NOT'** on the server and **'NOT'** on the client-side/browser.
            
      - 'getStaticProps()' function ALWAYS have to return an object. 
              1. So we can fetch data from inside the 'getStaticProps()' function and after the data is fetched, 
              2. we can pass it to the page component via 'props', by returning an 'object' with a 'props' property as a 'key' which contains another object as a value,
              3. and then that 'object' will contain the 'props' that we want to pass to the page component. 
                    'key' will be the prop name and 'value' wil be the props value.
            
                    
      --- SUMMARY ---
      - 'NextJS' executes the 'getStaticProps()' function BEFORE executing our page component function, during the pre-rendering process.
                So 'NextJS' will:    1. First execute the 'getStaticProps()' function in a Page component, which is ussually code to fetch data from a database
                                     2. Then it will pass that fetched data to the Page component function via props 
                                     3. And *THEN* 'NextJS' will execute the Page component function with the fetched data passed into it as 'props', through the 'getStaticProps()' function.
                                     4. Thus the pre-rendered Page component HTML will contain the fetched data, and 'crawlers' will be able to see that content which is good for 'SEO'.
                      
                      
                      
    // -- example 
          // -- 'HomePage.jsx' file

                    const HomePage = (props) => {

                      return <MeetupList meetups={meetups} />;

/ `  Incremental Static Regeneration  with 'getStaticProps()' function  `  /     -->     'ISR'

                                     


    - ‚õîüõëüöè  A problem we might be face when using 'getStaticProps()' function, in some websites depending on what we are doing,
                      Is that the pre-rendered HTML pages that contain our fetched data (through 'getStaticProps()' function) during the build process, could be 'OUTDATED'. 
                                 
                           So when we fetch data from database through 'getStaticProps()' function -> build the page -> then deploy.  If we THEN change the data in our database AFTER deploying the app, then that updated data will not showup on our deployed app since we didnt add any client-side data fetching.
                           
                            Solutions:  „Ä∞ We can ofcourse re-build and re-deploy our app with the updated fetched data from the database, when our data changes, which is fine if data doesnt change frequently on a                                                   website, like a blog for instance.  
                                        BUT if data DOES change more frequently, then re-building and re-deploying the website is not the best solution.
                                        
                                        „Ä∞ ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê To solve this we can use 'Incremental Static Regeneration', by adding an extra property to returned object inside the 'getStaticProps()' function.
                                                    - That property is the 'revalidate' property.
                                                    - When we add the 'revalidate' property in 'getStaticProps()' function returned object,  we unlock a feature called 'Incremental Static Regeneration'
                                                    - 'revalidate' property wants a number as a value, which is the number of seconds that 'NextJS' will wait until it re-generates that page for an incoming request
                                                    - so that means that when we use the 'revalidate' property, that page will 'NOT ONLY' get generated during the build process, 
                                                          but it will also be generated every couple of seconds on the 'SERVER', for any incoming requests for that page
                                                          so a 'revalidate: 10' means that that page will be re-generated every 10 seconds IF there are incoming requests for that page, and then the newly generated pages                                                           on the server will replace the previously generated pages.
                                                    with that we ensure that our data is never outdated by regenerating the page with any new data (if any) every 10 seconds, so that we dont have to re-build and re-deploy our app just because a data changed in our database.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
      // -- example
                  const HomePage = (props) => {

                    const { meetups } = props;

                    return <MeetupList meetups={meetups} />;
                  };

// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/ `  Server-Side Rendering  with 'getServerSideProps()' function  `  /     -->     'SSR'
          
          
          
     - Sometimes 'Incremental Static Regeneration' is not enough. And we want to Re-render a page on every single incoming request.
          
     - So we want to render a page 'dynamically' on the fly after the deployment on the server.
            NOT during the build process ('Static-Site Generation') and NOT every couple of seconds (with 'Incremental Site Regeneration'). 
             But on every request.
             
      - To acheive that we could use the 'getServerSideProps()' function.
          Just like 'getStaticProps', 'getServerSideProps' is a reserved name that 'NextJS' will be looking for.
      
      - ‚≠ê The difference between 'getStaticProps' and 'getServerSideProps' is that unlike 'getStaticProps', 'getServerSideProps' will NOT run during the build process 'npm run build', but instead it will 'always run on the server after deployment'.
            


      - using 'getServerSideProps()' function, we still return an object that contain a 'props' property which holds all the props that we want to pass to our page component
      
      - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê any code inside 'getServerSideProps()' function, will 'ONLY run on the server', 'NEVER' on the client/browser.
            so we can run server-side code here, or perform operations that use credentials that should not be exposed to the client/browser.
            
            
      - we cant use the 'revalidate' prop in the returned object of 'getServerSideProps()' function, simply because it doesnt make any sense.
          with 'getServerSideProps()' function the page gets rendered on the server with every request anyways, and 'revalidate' prop lets us implement 'Incremental Static Regeneration' which Re-generates the page only after the specified time in seconds has passed, and upon getting a new request from the client.
          
          
      - We receive a 'context' argument when using 'getServerSideProps()' function. Which is an object that contains a 'request' object that is sent to the server and a 'response' object that will be sent back to the client.     Will be able to understand this more once I take 'NodeJS' COURSE

/  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  `  Which should we use 'getStaticProps()' or 'getServerSideProps()' function  `  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


      - 'getServerSideProps()' might sound better because it is garanteed to run for every request, BUT that can be a disadvantage because that means that we need to wait for our page to get generated on the server on every incoming request.
      
      - üåüüü¢üåü If we dont have data that changes 'MULTIPLE TIMES every SECOND' and if we dont need access to the 'request' object, for instance for authenication (as we do in 'getServerSideProps()'), 
        
            then 'getStaticProps()' is the better option to use, because with it: 
                                               - üåü We pre-generate an HTML file. That HTML file is then stored and served to the Client by a 'CDN', 
                                                        which is simply FASTER than re-generating and fetching that data on every incoming request. 
                                                     
     - So our page will be faster when working with 'getStaticProps()' because then it can be 'CACHED' and re-used instead of re-generated on every request.

/  ` 'getStaticPaths()' function   -->   for Dynamic Routes when using 'getStaticProps()'  `  

     
   - If a page has Dynamic Routes AND uses 'getStaticProps()', it needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated using 'getStaticPaths()' function.

   - When you export a function called 'getStaticPaths()' (Static Site Generation) from a page that uses dynamic routes, 'Nextjs' will statically pre-render all the paths specified by 'getStaticPaths()'.
   
   - We need a way to identify a specific detail content using its id inorder to display its content in the dynamic detailPage.
        Inorder to do so, we can use the 'useRouter()' hook which lets us get the detailId parameter that was pushed to the URL and from there we can loop over the data in the database to identify that detail using its id -> then fetch its data inorder to display it in the detailPage.
   
   - ‚≠ê BUT We CANNOT use React Hooks inside the 'getStaticPaths()' or 'getServerSideProps()' functions because REMEMBER:  
              „Ä∞ we can ONLY USE/call Hooks from inside React function components and NOT from regular JavaScript functions

        so how do we get access to the dynamic Route in the URL using the 'useRouter' hook??   
              
   - ‚≠ê 'getStaticProps()' receives an argument called 'context', which is an object that contains a 'params' property which we can use to get access to the dynamic Route parameter in the URL.
   
          'context.params' is also an object where our dynamic Route identifier (folder/file name of the dynamic page in 'pages' folder -> '[detailId]')  will be available as a 'key' and its 'value' will be the detailId parameter encoded in the URL.
          
   üü°üü¢üîµ  --------------   üü°üü¢üîµ
   `   When to use 'getStaticPaths()'   `
   
  - 'getStaticPaths()' is a function we need to export in a page component file, if:
                  1. that page is a dynamic page that will be used do display different content
                  2. And when we are using 'getStaticProps()',
                        üõë NOT if we are using 'getServerSideProps()' and NOT if we are NOT using neither 'getStaticProps()' or 'getServerSideProps()' in a page component.
   --------------------------------


    - REMEMBER, with 'getStaticProps()' a page component is pre-generated during the build process ('npm run build'), 
          which means that if we have a dynamic page that will be used to display different content for different URL paths, then 'Nextjs' needs to pre-generate ALL the different versions of that dynamic page in advance, during the build process, for all the different detail Ids that will be used to identify a certain detail and fetch its data for the dynamic detail page.
          
     As a result since the detail page is dynamic, 'NextJS' needs to know for which detailId values it should pre-generate the dynamic detail page with that detailId content. 
      
     üìù SIDE NOTE:  We get the detailId from the URL inorder to get the data of a certain detail and display its content in the dynamic detail page.
     
   --------------------------------
    ` Using 'getStaticPaths()' `

     - 'getStaticPaths()' function can be 'async' just like 'getStaticProps()' & 'getServerSideProps'()', inorder to use async/await inside.
     - 'getStaticPaths()' returns an 'object' where we describe all the dynamic file/page segment values  (so all the 'meetupId' for which the dynamic page should be generated)

            „Ä∞ The returned 'object' need to have a 'paths' key which contains an 'array'.  
                  And in that 'array' we must have multiple 'objects' (ONE 'object' per Version of the dynamic page).
                      That 'object' should have a 'params' key which contains another 'object' that contains all the key/value pairs that might lead to our dynamic page
                      
     - 'getStaticPaths()' also need a 'fallback' key property in its returned object. 
            This 'key' tells 'Nextjs' whether our 'paths' array contains ALL of the different 'params' values for our dynamic page, or just some of them.
            
            „Ä∞ 'fallback: false'  ->  means that our 'paths' array contains ALL supported detailId values. Which means that if the user enters a detailId 'param' in the URL for the dynamic page that doesnt exist in the 'getStaticPaths()' 'paths' property, then they will get a '404' page 
            
            „Ä∞ 'fallback: true'  ->  then 'Nextjs' will render the dynamic page for that detailId dynamically on the server.
            
            
    // -- example
                    
          // 'getStaticPaths()'  ->  Have to use when we have dynamic pages ([meetupId]) and are pre-generating pages using 'getStaticProps()', so that 'Nextjs' knows what pages to pre-generate during the build process.
          export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
            return {
              paths: [{ params: { meetupId: "m1" } }, { params: { meetupId: "m2" } }],
              fallback: false,
            };
          };

/ ` Building a Backend API with Nextjs using --> * API Routes *` 


  - 'Nextjs' makes it easy for us to build a backend API together with our Frontend React App, in the SAME project/repository, using a 'Nextjs' feature calles 'API Routes'.
            
  - 'API Routes' are a special routes/pages which doesnt return HTML code, but instead:
                                „Ä∞ Accept incoming Http requests ('POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE' requests) with JSON data attached to them.
                                        and then we can do anything we want with those requests, like store data in a database and then return JSON data.
                                        
   ‚≠ê So 'API Routes' allows us to allows us to build our own API endpoints as part of the 'Nextjs' app, and they will be served by the same server as our 'Nextjs' app ‚≠ê
   
   
   ` Adding API Routes in our Nextjs app `
   
   1. To add 'API Routes' in our 'Nextjs' app, we add a special folder called 'api', inside the 'pages' folder.
            'Nextjs' will pick up any javascript files stored in the 'api' folder and turn those files into 'API Routes', so into endpoints that could be targeted by HTTP requests and that should 'receive' and 'return' JSON. 
            
   2. In that 'api' folder, we can add JavaScript files, where the file names will path segments in the URL, just like with files inside the pages folder through 'file-based routing'.
   
        - In those JavaScript 'API Route' files inside the 'api' folder, we DONT create react component funcitons because these 'API Routes' are not about defining, rendering, or returning React components, instead in there we will define functions which contain 'server-side' code,
              ‚≠ê because 'API Routes' wilL ONLY run on the 'server' and NEVER on the client-side/browser. The code in them will never be exposed to the 'client' so we can also use credentials in API Routes without compromising them  ->  
                 and then those functions are simply triggered whenever a request is sent to the 'API Route' through its path, ie: '/api/[API Route file name]'.
                 
   3. The 'API Route' function:
   
              - is ussually named 'handler'
              - must bethe default export of the 'API Route' file, ie: 'export defualt handler'
              - will receive a 'req' and 'res' objects as arguments, just like in 'Nodejs' and 'Expressjs'.
                      „Ä∞ 'req' object contains data about the incoming request. From this object we can get things like the 'headers' or the request 'body'.
                            We can also get the request method through the method property ('req.method'), which allows us to findout what kind of request was sent.
                      „Ä∞ 'res' object will be needed for sending back a response
                      
                      
                      
                      
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/  `  'head' Metadata in Nextjs  `  
                      
                      
   - We can use the '<Head/>' component provided to us by 'Nextjs' inorder to add metatags to the '<head/>' html element in each page.
                      
                      
                
                      
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/  `  Deploying 'Nextjs' apps  `

   
   - There are different hosting providers we can use to deploy our 'Nextjs' app. 
   - There are different ways of configuring our 'Nextjs' apps as well, for example we can use 'Environment Variables' to hold our database credentials for instance.
   
   - In this course, we use 'Vercel' hosting provider which is the same team that developed 'Nextjs'. So it is optimized for 'Nextjs'
   
   -- Steps to deploying to 'Vercel'
          1. Signup with a 'git' repository provider like 'GitHub', or 'BitBucket'. 
                  because with 'Vercel' we will directly link our 'GitHub repository' which hold our app source code to 'Vercel', and then 'Vercel' will get our source code from that repository and deploy it for us.
          2. Once 'Vercel' is connected to our GitHub repository, Vercel will build and deploy our 'Nextjs' app for us whenever we push a 'commit ' to the repository. So we dont need to run 'npm run build', 'Vercel' will do that for us.
                      

                      
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
/  `  Fallback Pages in 'Nextjs' apps  `   
          
          'fallback' property inside 'getStaticPaths()' returned object. 
          
      - 'Dynamic Page' uses 'getStaticPaths()' inorder for 'Nextjs' to know what pages to pre-generate the Dynamic pages HTML for.  
      
            If a new path needs to be generated on the server after the app was deployed, inorder to prevent the user from getting a '404 page' since that path was not pre-generated.
      

         „Ä∞ If 'fallback' is set to 'false', then any requests to a certain dynamic page that was NOT pre-generated during the build process, will result in a '404' page.
         
         „Ä∞ If 'fallback' is set to 'true' or 'blocking', we are telling 'Nextjs' that the list of paths we are specifying might not be the full list of paths, and there might be more valid pages.
         Therefore, when 'fallback' is set to 'true' or 'blocking', 'Nextjs' will not respond with a '404' page if it cant find the page immediatly, instead with 'fallback' is set to 'true' or 'blocking', it will then generate that page on 'demand' and thereafter 'cache' it. So it will be pre-generated when needed.
         
         Difference between 'fallback' set to 'true' and 'blocking' is that:
                   -  with 'true' it would immediatly return an empty page, and then pull the dynamically generated content once its done.
                          So we would need to handle the case where the page oes not have the data yet.
                   - whereas with 'blocking', the user will not see anything until the page was dynamically generated, and then the finished page will be served.


     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  SUMMARY -->  Always set 'fallback' to 'blocking' when using 'getStaticPaths()' ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


          // --- example

                  export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
                    // Dynamically generating Paths array

                    // connect to database (returns a promise)

 / ` Animating React Apps `



  - We can use CSS 'transition' and '@keyframes & animation' properties to animate components in react apps by adding and removing classes, depending on a state.
          So the react component will always be rendered in the DOM, but just hidden or visible depending on the classes it has, 
                which is perfectly fine since CSS animations is better in terms of performance.   'But is also have some limitations'

      Some limitations of CSS 'transition' and '@keyframes & animation' properties are :
         1. One limitation is that elements animated through CSS, are always present/rendered on the DOM, they are just hidden or visible depending on the classes they have. 
         
                                üëÜ This means that all of our HTML code is ALWAYS in the DOM, which 
                                              „Ä∞Ô∏è populates our DOM with alot of elements which slows our page down alittle bit
                                              „Ä∞Ô∏è might also not be best for accessibilty
                                              „Ä∞Ô∏è and really goes against Reactjs, since we are controlling elements by CSS instead of mounting and unmounting components.                                 Which is all not that big of a deal. Especially if we are just dealing with a Modal windows or a side drawer menu.

                ‚≠ê‚≠ê Adding animation to an element as it is 'mounted/rendered' can be done through CSS 'transition' or 'animation' properties, but animating an element as it is 'unmounted' *CANNOT* be done with CSS, since 'React' instantly removes the element from the DOM.  
                        The reason for this is that 'React' doesnt wait until a CSS animation is finished before removing an element, because it is NOT aware of that CSS animation. It is also good that 'React' doesnt scan our to be removed elements inorder to possibly delay their unmounting until their exit CSS animation is finished, because that would be a performance nightmare. ‚≠ê‚≠ê
                        
                     -----------
                        SUMMARY -->   -  So annimating an element as it is mounted/rendered through CSS is easy
                                      -  üõë But animating an element as it is removed/unmounted from the DOM cannot be done since React doesnt wait for the CSS animation to finish before removing the element from the DOM.
                     -----------
                                        
                                        

  - üü¢ Inorder to animate elements as they 'unmount' we can use different tools/packages: 
  
        - We use 'React Transition Group' package in the course, which allows us to smoothly transition elements by delaying their 'mount' and 'unmount' states from the DOM, until their animations are finished.
        
        
          „Ä∞Ô∏è We used the '<Transition>' component from 'React Transition Group' package  ->  which delays the 'mounting' and 'unmounting' of a component until a css animation is finished through CSS class or inline-styles.
          
          „Ä∞Ô∏è Also use the '<CSSTransition' component from 'React Transition Group' package was used  ->  'http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition'

                            ‚≠ê There is NOTHING WRONG with using 'React-Redux' to manage global/app-wide state ‚≠ê
    
                                                                                                      
    - We might want to not use 'React-Redux' and use built-in 'Context API' and 'custom React Hooks' instead, due to a couple of reasons
                                                                                                      
            1. Maybe we want to only use the tools 'React' gives us. And we dont want to learn 'Redux'  (ie: Lazy üò™)
            
            2. Or maybe we dont want to increase our production bundle size by adding the 'React-Redux' package. And thus we would ship less code to the browser when we deploy the app and the app would load faster.
                      ‚≠ê Even tho it might not even matter if we a have a really large app ‚≠ê
                      
            3. Or we might we want to simply explore how we could pass data between components without 'props drilling' and without 'Redux'


----------------------------
/ ` Two different approaches of managing our global/app-wide state with React ONLY tools `
            
            One approach is a good one üëç, and the other is not that great (atleast no for all usecases) ü§¢
            
     --------------
    1. 'FIRST' approach using the built-in 'Context API'    (sometimes the right choice, but NOT ALWAYS)

      (see 'react-replacing-reduc-with-react-hooks' app)

            üõëüõë‚õî Down-side of using 'Context API' for managing app-wide state üõëüõë‚õî 
               
             „Ä∞ React 'Context API' is NOT optimized for hight frequency changes. ie: not optimitzed for states that changes every second or even multiple times/second.
                      üåü If we DO have a state that needs to be Global and that also changes often we can use 'REDUX'.
                      
             „Ä∞ 'Redux' is a state solution that we generally prefer for big applications. 
                  You could very well build a medium scale application with just 'Context API' and 'React Hooks', so you don't really need Redux for it but you can use it there too.

     SUMMARY: 
        So its best to use 'Context API' if we want to manage state that has very low frequency to be updated/changed. Like user authenication or a theme state update. 
              This is because  whenever a state changes in our app, the 'Context API' doesnt have a clever way of figuring out which component was updates inorder to only re-render that component, instead it re-rerenders all the components wrapped inside it, along with their children, as oppose to 'Redux' which only updates subscribed components that were updated.
        
        Whereas if we have a Shopping Cart for instance which is a state that changes more often, then using 'Context API' is not the best option. Use 'Redux' or another package/solution instead.
        


     --------------
    2. SECOND approach is creating our own 'Custom Hooks' as a Store, inorder to manage global/App-wide state
    
        Check 'replacing-redux-with-hooks' app

    - 'Automated testing' is about writing code, to test our code.
              'Automated testing' is an important part of writing modern application. It is such a big topic that we can create entire courses about just testing.
              
    
// -------------------------------------    
/ --- What is 'Testing'?  ``

    - 'Manual Testing' which means that we as a developer write some code to implement a feature and then we test it in the Browser.
              Important because we see what our users will see. 
    
        DOWNSIDE ->  Testing the app manually is 'Error-prone' because its hard to test all possible combinations and scenarios.
                          For instance if we add a new feature in the app, we only test that feature. We dont test everything all the time.
                            And Since we dont test the entire app everytime we implement a new feature. That new feature might have caused bugs/breaking changes to other already existing features in the app, that we are not aware of and might result in more work later down the road. Thats where 'Automated Testing' comes in.
    
    - 'Automated Testing' is NOT a replacement for manual tetsing, instead it is an addition. With 'Automated testing' we write extra code that runs and tests our main app code.
        „Ä∞ This is a standard thing to do in Modern Development. 
        „Ä∞ The good thing about 'Automated testing', is that since we write code that tests our entire application automatically, we can always test everything no matter                      what new feature we add. 
        „Ä∞ So we write test that tests the individual building blocks of the app, which then tests all those building blocks together. Whenever we make changes to the code, instead of only testing pARTS of our app from time to time.

        üëÜüëÜ Very technical, but allows us to test everything ALL the time.


    Summary --> 'Manual Testing' combined with 'Automatic Testing' allows us to catch bug way earlier and allows us to write and ship better code and applications.
  
  
// -------------------------------------
/ --- Different types of 'Automated Testing'?
  
    There are three main categories of 'Automated Testing'  ->  'Unit Tests', 'Integration Tests', 'End-to-End (e2e) tests'
  
   - 'Unit Tests' : 
              „Ä∞ are all about writing tests for individual components/functions, in isolation.    So apps ussually contains ALOT of unit Test. 
              „Ä∞ ‚≠ê This is the most common and important kind of test ‚≠ê
              „Ä∞ The idea behind is that if we test each of the individual units by themselves, the overall of the application will also work.

              
   - 'Integration Tests' :
              „Ä∞ Lets us verify that all the individual components/units work together, where we test the combination of multiple building blocks of the app, 
                  like multiple components working together.
              „Ä∞ Apps ussually contain a couple of Integration tests.
              „Ä∞ It is not always easy to differentiate between 'Unit tests' and 'Integration tests' when testing React apps, since very often we want to test a component                     that also uses some other component.
              
              ‚≠ê Also important, but focus on 'Unit Tests' in most cases ‚≠ê
              
              
   - 'End-to-End (e2e) tests' :
              „Ä∞ End-to-End (e2e) tests are all about testing ENTIRE workflows. 
              „Ä∞ Tests entire scenarios in your app as the user would experience them. 
                    Like logging a user in and then going to a different page.
              „Ä∞ So 'End-to-End (e2e) tests' is basically what we would do with 'manual tetsing', but automated
              „Ä∞ ‚≠ê We dont write as much 'End-to-End (e2e) tests' as we write 'Unit tests' and 'Integration tests', because if our 'Unit tests' and 'Integration tests' pass sucessfully, then we can be pretty sure that                          our overall application works fine. 
                  And also because 'Unit tests' and 'Integration tests' are simply easier to test, quicker to run, and more focused.  
                    (Way easier to test all possible scenarios of individual components if we run 'Unit tests', than it is to test all possible scenarios of the entire app with 'End-to-End (e2e) tests') ‚≠ê 

                  
                  
                                ***** In the course we only focus on 'Unit tests' and 'Integration Tests' *****

// ------------------------------------- 
/ --- What to Test?
  
    - For 'Unit Testing', we want to test the different building blocks that make up the application. 
                            We want to test SMALL building blocks, so that we have small focused test that only test 'ONE main' thing EACH.

          So that we would have ALOT of small tests that each could fail for a clear reason, rather than have a few large test that could fail for all kinds of reasons.



/ --- How to Test?
  
    - We want to test 'success' and 'error' cases. Also test rare (but possible) cases.
    
   
    
    
// ------------------------------------- 
/ --- Required 'Tools' & 'Setup' for testing code? 
  
    - Inorder to write and execute tests, we need:

                                        „Ä∞ A tool for running our test and asserting the results (for determining whther a result can be seen as a 'success' or 'fail') 
                                                 'Package'  ->  We typically use 'Jest' package as a tool to run and assert tests in our app.
  
                                        „Ä∞ In our React apps, we also need a tool for 'simulating' (rendering) our React app/components, inorder for those automated test to then interact with.
                                                 'Package'  ->  For simulating and rendering our app/components for tests, we typically use the 'React Testing Library' 


                     ********  Both 'Jest' and 'React Testing Library' packages are already installed and set up for us when we create a project using 'create-react-app'  ********
